00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:05,430
JIM LEHRER: Good evening from the Magness
Arena at the University of Denver in Denver,

2
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:12,340
Colorado. I'm Jim Lehrer of the PBS NewsHour,
and I welcome you to the first of the 2012

3
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:17,350
presidential debates between President Barack
Obama, the Democratic nominee, and former

4
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:22,210
Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney, the Republican
nominee.

5
00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:27,850
This debate and the next three — two presidential,
one vice- presidential — are sponsored by

6
00:00:27,850 --> 00:00:31,070
the Commission on Presidential Debates.

7
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:37,239
Tonight's 90 minutes will be about domestic
issues, and will follow a format designed

8
00:00:37,239 --> 00:00:43,930
by the commission. There will be six roughly
15-minute segments, with two-minute answers

9
00:00:43,930 --> 00:00:49,730
for the first question, then open discussion
for the remainder of each segment.

10
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:55,539
Thousands of people offered suggestions on
segment subjects of questions via the Internet

11
00:00:55,539 --> 00:01:01,800
and other means, but I made the final selections,
and for the record, they were not submitted

12
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:04,759
for approval to the commission or the candidates.

13
00:01:04,759 --> 00:01:12,200
The segments, as I announced in advance, will
be three on the economy and one each on health

14
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:20,009
care, the role of government, and governing,
with an emphasis throughout on differences,

15
00:01:20,009 --> 00:01:26,099
specifics and choices. Both candidates will
also have two-minute closing statements.

16
00:01:26,099 --> 00:01:32,840
The audience here in the hall has promised
to remain silent. No cheers, applause, boos,

17
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:39,240
hisses — among other noisy distracting things
— so we may all concentrate on what the

18
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:46,119
candidates have to say. There is a noise exception
right now, though, as we welcome President

19
00:01:46,119 --> 00:02:11,250
Obama and Governor Romney. (Cheers, applause.)

20
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:20,069
Gentlemen, welcome to you both.

21
00:02:20,069 --> 00:02:28,680
Let's start the economy, segment one. And
let's begin with jobs. What are the major

22
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:37,640
differences between the two of you about how
you would go about creating new jobs? You

23
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:41,870
have two minutes — each of you have two
minutes to start. The coin toss has determined,

24
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:41,870
Mr. President, you go first.

25
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:45,989
PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: Well, thank you very
much, Jim, for this opportunity. I want to

26
00:02:45,989 --> 00:02:49,060
thank Governor Romney and the University of
Denver for your hospitality.

27
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:54,760
There are a lot of points that I want to make
tonight, but the most important one is that

28
00:02:54,760 --> 00:03:00,200
20 years ago I became the luckiest man on
earth because Michelle Obama agreed to marry

29
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:06,079
me. (Laughter.) And so I just want to wish,
Sweetie, you happy anniversary and let you

30
00:03:06,079 --> 00:03:10,519
know that a year from now, we will not be
celebrating it in front of 40 million people.

31
00:03:10,519 --> 00:03:11,319
(Laughter.)

32
00:03:11,319 --> 00:03:18,900
You know, four years ago we went through the
worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.

33
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:23,920
Millions of jobs were lost. The auto industry
was on the brink of collapse. The financial

34
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:30,599
system had frozen up. And because of the resilience
and the determination of the American people,

35
00:03:30,599 --> 00:03:32,209
we've begun to fight our way back.

36
00:03:32,209 --> 00:03:38,409
Over the last 30 months, we've seen 5 million
jobs in the private sector created. The auto

37
00:03:38,409 --> 00:03:45,249
industry has come roaring back and housing
has begun to rise. But we all know that we've

38
00:03:45,249 --> 00:03:49,950
still got a lot of work to do. And so the
question here tonight is not where we've been

39
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:58,969
but where we're going. Governor Romney has
a perspective that says if we cut taxes, skewed

40
00:03:58,969 --> 00:04:03,579
towards the wealthy, and roll back regulations
that we'll be better off.

41
00:04:03,579 --> 00:04:07,969
I've got a different view. I think we've got
to invest in education and training. I think

42
00:04:07,969 --> 00:04:12,099
it's important for us to develop new sources
of energy here in America, that we change

43
00:04:12,099 --> 00:04:16,260
our tax code to make sure that we're helping
small businesses and companies that are investing

44
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:21,060
here in the United States, that we take some
of the money that we're saving as we wind

45
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:27,940
down two wars to rebuild America and that
we reduce our deficit in a balanced way that

46
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:30,370
allows us to make these critical investments.

47
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:35,150
Now, it ultimately is going to be up to the
voters, to you, which path we should take.

48
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:39,870
Are we going to double down on the top-down
economic policies that helped to get us into

49
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:46,560
this mess, or do we embrace a new economic
patriotism that says, America does best when

50
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,520
the middle class does best? And I'm looking
forward to having that debate.

51
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,000
MR. LEHRER: Governor Romney, two minutes.

52
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,199
MR. ROMNEY: Thank you, Jim. It's an honor
to be here with you, and I appreciate the

53
00:04:54,199 --> 00:04:58,020
chance to be with the president. I am pleased
to be at the University of Denver, appreciate

54
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:02,330
their welcome and also the presidential commission
on these debates.

55
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:05,889
And congratulations to you, Mr. President,
on your anniversary. I'm sure this was the

56
00:05:05,889 --> 00:05:11,610
most romantic place you could imagine here
— here with me, so I — (laughter) — congratulations.

57
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:17,110
This is obviously a very tender topic. I've
had the occasion over the last couple of years

58
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:22,150
of meeting people across the country. I was
in Dayton, Ohio, and a woman grabbed my arm,

59
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:25,650
and she said, I've been out of work since
May. Can you help me?

60
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:31,509
Ann yesterday was a rally in Denver, and a
woman came up to her with a baby in her arms

61
00:05:31,509 --> 00:05:36,830
and said, Ann, my husband has had four jobs
in three years, part-time jobs. He's lost

62
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:41,669
his most recent job, and we've now just lost
our home. Can you help us?

63
00:05:41,669 --> 00:05:47,539
And the answer is yes, we can help, but it's
going to take a different path, not the one

64
00:05:47,539 --> 00:05:53,520
we've been on, not the one the president describes
as a top-down, cut taxes for the rich. That's

65
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,770
not what I'm going to do.

66
00:05:54,770 --> 00:05:59,949
My plan has five basic parts. One, get us
energy independent, North American energy

67
00:05:59,949 --> 00:06:04,840
independent. That creates about four million
jobs. Number two, open up more trade, particularly

68
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:09,580
in Latin America; crack down on China if and
when they cheat. Number three, make sure our

69
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:13,780
people have the skills they need to succeed
and the best schools in the world. We're far

70
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:20,139
away from that now. Number four, get us to
a balanced budget. Number five, champion small

71
00:06:20,139 --> 00:06:20,789
business.

72
00:06:20,789 --> 00:06:26,060
It's small business that creates the jobs
in America. And over the last four years small-business

73
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:30,220
people have decided that America may not be
the place to open a new business, because

74
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:36,210
new business startups are down to a 30-year
low. I know what it takes to get small business

75
00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:37,870
growing again, to hire people.

76
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:42,479
Now, I'm concerned that the path that we're
on has just been unsuccessful. The president

77
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:47,080
has a view very similar to the view he had
when he ran four years ago, that a bigger

78
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:52,610
government, spending more, taxing more, regulating
more — if you will, trickle-down government

79
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:57,270
would work. That's not the right answer for
America. I'll restore the vitality that gets

80
00:06:57,270 --> 00:06:59,050
America working again.

81
00:06:59,050 --> 00:06:59,530
Thank you.

82
00:06:59,530 --> 00:07:04,430
MR. LEHRER: Mr. President, please respond
directly to what the governor just said about

83
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:09,800
trickle-down — his trickle-down approach.
He's — as he said yours is.

84
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:14,479
PRESIDENT OBAMA: Well, let me talk specifically
about what I think we need to do.

85
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:20,349
First, we've got to improve our education
system. And we've made enormous progress drawing

86
00:07:20,349 --> 00:07:26,120
on ideas both from Democrats and Republicans
that are already starting to show gains in

87
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:30,530
some of the toughest-to- deal-with schools.
We've got a program called Race to the Top

88
00:07:30,530 --> 00:07:37,250
that has prompted reforms in 46 states around
the country, raising standards, improving

89
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:41,860
how we train teachers. So now I want to hire
another hundred thousand new math and science

90
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:47,400
teachers and create 2 million more slots in
our community colleges so that people can

91
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:51,430
get trained for the jobs that are out there
right now. And I want to make sure that we

92
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:54,560
keep tuition low for our young people.

93
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:59,849
When it comes to our tax code, Governor Romney
and I both agree that our corporate tax rate

94
00:07:59,849 --> 00:08:06,039
is too high. So I want to lower it, particularly
for manufacturing, taking it down to 25 percent.

95
00:08:06,039 --> 00:08:12,319
But I also want to close those loopholes that
are giving incentives for companies that are

96
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:16,250
shipping jobs overseas. I want to provide
tax breaks for companies that are investing

97
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:18,349
here in the United States.

98
00:08:18,349 --> 00:08:23,340
On energy, Governor Romney and I, we both
agree that we've got to boost American energy

99
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:24,379
production.

100
00:08:24,379 --> 00:08:31,379
And oil and natural gas production are higher
than they've been in years. But I also believe

101
00:08:31,379 --> 00:08:36,270
that we've got to look at the energy source
of the future, like wind and solar and biofuels,

102
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:38,230
and make those investments.

103
00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:42,750
So, all of this is possible. Now, in order
for us to do it, we do have to close our deficit,

104
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:47,200
and one of the things I'm sure we'll be discussing
tonight is, how do we deal with our tax code,

105
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:51,700
and how do we make sure that we are reducing
spending in a responsible way, but also how

106
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:55,730
do we have enough revenue to make those investments?
And this is where there's a difference because

107
00:08:55,730 --> 00:09:02,780
Governor Romney's central economic plan calls
for a $5 trillion tax cut, on top of the extension

108
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:07,000
of the Bush tax cuts, so that's another $2
trillion, and $2 trillion in additional military

109
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:13,170
spending that the military hasn't asked for.
That's $8 trillion. How we pay for that, reduce

110
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:18,820
the deficit and make the investments that
we need to make without dumping those costs

111
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:22,230
on the middle-class Americans I think is one
of the central questions of this campaign.

112
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:26,680
MR. LEHRER: Both of you have spoken about
a lot of different things, and we're going

113
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:30,680
to try to get through them in as specific
a way as we possibly can.

114
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:34,050
But first, Governor Romney, do you have a
question that you'd like to ask the president

115
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:36,060
directly about something he just said?

116
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:39,390
MR. ROMNEY: Well, sure. I'd like to clear
up the record and go through it piece by piece.

117
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:44,050
First of all, I don't have a $5 trillion tax
cut. I don't have a tax cut of a scale that

118
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:48,650
you're talking about. My view is that we ought
to provide tax relief to people in the middle

119
00:09:48,650 --> 00:09:53,360
class. But I'm not going to reduce the share
of taxes paid by high- income people. High-income

120
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,940
people are doing just fine in this economy.
They'll do fine whether you're president or

121
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:57,550
I am.

122
00:09:57,550 --> 00:10:01,980
The people who are having the hard time right
now are middle- income Americans. Under the

123
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:05,900
president's policies, middle-income Americans
have been buried. They're — they're just

124
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:12,910
being crushed. Middle-income Americans have
seen their income come down by $4,300. This

125
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:18,040
is a — this is a tax in and of itself. I'll
call it the economy tax. It's been crushing.

126
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:22,470
The same time, gasoline prices have doubled
under the president, electric rates are up,

127
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:28,630
food prices are up, health care costs have
gone up by $2,500 a family.

128
00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:31,800
Middle-income families are being crushed.
And so the question is how to get them going

129
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:36,460
again, and I've described it. It's energy
and trade, the right kind of training programs,

130
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:41,600
balancing our budget and helping small business.
Those are the — the cornerstones of my plan.

131
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:45,260
But the president mentioned a couple of other
ideas, and I'll just note: first, education.

132
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:50,540
I agree, education is key, particularly the
future of our economy. But our training programs

133
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:55,020
right now, we got 47 of them housed in the
federal government, reporting to eight different

134
00:10:55,020 --> 00:11:00,100
agencies. Overhead is overwhelming. We got
to get those dollars back to the states and

135
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:03,890
go to the workers so they can create their
own pathways to getting the training they

136
00:11:03,890 --> 00:11:06,440
need for jobs that will really help them.

137
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:10,930
The second area: taxation. We agree; we ought
to bring the tax rates down, and I do, both

138
00:11:10,930 --> 00:11:15,830
for corporations and for individuals. But
in order for us not to lose revenue, have

139
00:11:15,830 --> 00:11:20,250
the government run out of money, I also lower
deductions and credits and exemptions so that

140
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:23,770
we keep taking in the same money when you
also account for growth.

141
00:11:23,770 --> 00:11:29,000
The third area: energy. Energy is critical,
and the president pointed out correctly that

142
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:34,830
production of oil and gas in the U.S. is up.
But not due to his policies. In spite of his

143
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:40,370
policies. Mr. President, all of the increase
in natural gas and oil has happened on private

144
00:11:40,370 --> 00:11:45,860
land, not on government land. On government
land, your administration has cut the number

145
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:52,740
of permits and license in half. If I'm president,
I'll double them. And also get the — the

146
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:56,910
oil from offshore and Alaska. And I'll bring
that pipeline in from Canada.

147
00:11:56,910 --> 00:12:01,650
And by the way, I like coal. I'm going to
make sure we continue to burn clean coal.

148
00:12:01,650 --> 00:12:05,580
People in the coal industry feel like it's
getting crushed by your policies. I want to

149
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:10,690
get America and North America energy independent,
so we can create those jobs.

150
00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:15,710
And finally, with regards to that tax cut,
look, I'm not looking to cut massive taxes

151
00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:20,130
and to reduce the — the revenues going to
the government. My — my number one principle

152
00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:22,580
is there'll be no tax cut that adds to the
deficit.

153
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:27,700
I want to underline that — no tax cut that
adds to the deficit. But I do want to reduce

154
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:33,310
the burden being paid by middle-income Americans.
And I — and to do that that also means that

155
00:12:33,310 --> 00:12:38,500
I cannot reduce the burden paid by high-income
Americans. So any — any language to the

156
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:39,850
contrary is simply not accurate.

157
00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:40,890
MR. LEHRER: Mr. President.

158
00:12:40,890 --> 00:12:46,350
PRESIDENT OBAMA: Well, I think — let's talk
about taxes because I think it's instructive.

159
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:53,830
Now, four years ago when I stood on this stage
I said that I would cut taxes for middle-class

160
00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:59,480
families. And that's exactly what I did. We
cut taxes for middle-class families by about

161
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:06,390
$3,600. And the reason is because I believe
we do best when the middle class is doing

162
00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:07,910
well.

163
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:13,360
And by giving them those tax cuts, they had
a little more money in their pocket and so

164
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:19,430
maybe they can buy a new car. They are certainly
in a better position to weather the extraordinary

165
00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:23,310
recession that we went through. They can buy
a computer for their kid who's going off to

166
00:13:23,310 --> 00:13:27,140
college, which means they're spending more
money, businesses have more customers, businesses

167
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:29,940
make more profits and then hire more workers.

168
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:36,520
Now, Governor Romney's proposal that he has
been promoting for 18 months calls for a $5

169
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:42,850
trillion tax cut on top of $2 trillion of
additional spending for our military. And

170
00:13:42,850 --> 00:13:48,120
he is saying that he is going to pay for it
by closing loopholes and deductions. The problem

171
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:53,200
is that he's been asked a — over a hundred
times how you would close those deductions

172
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:56,680
and loopholes and he hasn't been able to identify
them.

173
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:58,250
But I'm going to make an important point here,
Jim.

174
00:13:58,250 --> 00:13:58,900
MR. LEHRER: All right.

175
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:05,130
PRESIDENT OBAMA: When you add up all the loopholes
and deductions that upper income individuals

176
00:14:05,130 --> 00:14:08,750
can — are currently taking advantage of
— if you take those all away — you don't

177
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:13,800
come close to paying for $5 trillion in tax
cuts and $2 trillion in additional military

178
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:19,360
spending. And that's why independent studies
looking at this said the only way to meet

179
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:25,140
Governor Romney's pledge of not reducing the
deficit — or — or — or not adding to

180
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:29,240
the deficit, is by burdening middle-class
families.

181
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:34,530
The average middle-class family with children
would pay about $2,000 more. Now, that's not

182
00:14:34,530 --> 00:14:38,920
my analysis; that's the analysis of economists
who have looked at this. And — and that

183
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:43,240
kind of top — top-down economics, where
folks at the top are doing well so the average

184
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:49,910
person making 3 million bucks is getting a
$250,000 tax break while middle- class families

185
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:54,120
are burdened further, that's not what I believe
is a recipe for economic growth.

186
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,390
MR. LEHRER: All right. What is the difference?

187
00:14:55,390 --> 00:14:55,810
MR. ROMNEY: Well —

188
00:14:55,810 --> 00:14:57,090
MR. LEHRER: Let's just stay on taxes for —

189
00:14:57,090 --> 00:14:57,960
MR. ROMNEY: But I — but I — right, right.

190
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:00,140
MR. LEHRER: OK. Yeah, just — let's just
stay on taxes for a moment.

191
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:00,910
MR. ROMNEY: Yeah. Well, but — but —

192
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:01,530
MR. LEHRER: What is the difference?

193
00:15:01,530 --> 00:15:03,970
MR. ROMNEY: — virtually every — virtually
everything he just said about my tax plan

194
00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:04,330
is inaccurate.

195
00:15:04,330 --> 00:15:04,920
MR. LEHRER: All right, go —

196
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:09,630
MR. ROMNEY: So — so if — if the tax plan
he described were a tax plan I was asked to

197
00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:14,260
support, I'd say absolutely not. I'm not looking
for a $5 trillion tax cut. What I've said

198
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:19,590
is I won't put in place a tax cut that adds
to the deficit. That's part one. So there's

199
00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:23,960
no economist can say Mitt Romney's tax plan
adds 5 trillion (dollars) if I say I will

200
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:26,640
not add to the deficit with my tax plan.

201
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:31,460
Number two, I will not reduce the share paid
by high-income individuals. I — I know that

202
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:34,460
you and your running mate keep saying that,
and I know it's a popular things to say with

203
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:39,790
a lot of people, but it's just not the case.
Look, I got five boys. I'm used to people

204
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:43,750
saying something that's not always true, but
just keep on repeating it and ultimately hoping

205
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:46,830
I'll believe it — (scattered laughter) — but
that — that is not the case, all right?

206
00:15:46,830 --> 00:15:51,160
I will not reduce the taxes paid by high-income
Americans.

207
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:57,080
And number three, I will not, under any circumstances,
raise taxes on middle-income families. I will

208
00:15:57,080 --> 00:16:01,910
lower taxes on middle-income families. Now,
you cite a study. There are six other studies

209
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:05,870
that looked at the study you describe and
say it's completely wrong. I saw a study that

210
00:16:05,870 --> 00:16:10,810
came out today that said you're going to raise
taxes by 3(,000 dollars) to $4,000 on — on

211
00:16:10,810 --> 00:16:13,180
middle-income families. There are all these
studies out there.

212
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:17,390
But let's get to the bottom line. That is,
I want to bring down rates. I want to bring

213
00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:21,270
down the rates down, at the same time lower
deductions and exemptions and credits and

214
00:16:21,270 --> 00:16:24,440
so forth so we keep getting the revenue we
need.

215
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:30,130
And you think, well, then why lower the rates?
And the reason is because small business pays

216
00:16:30,130 --> 00:16:35,150
that individual rate. Fifty-four percent of
America's workers work in businesses that

217
00:16:35,150 --> 00:16:40,720
are taxed not at the corporate tax rate but
at the individual tax rate. And if we lower

218
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:44,660
that rate, they will be able to hire more
people.

219
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:46,120
For me, this is about jobs.

220
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:46,650
MR. LEHRER: All right. That's where we started.

221
00:16:46,650 --> 00:16:48,880
MR. ROMNEY: This is about getting jobs for
the American people.

222
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:49,560
MR. LEHRER: Yeah.

223
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:53,420
Do you challenge what the governor just said
about his own plan?

224
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:59,340
PRESIDENT OBAMA: Well, for 18 months he's
been running on this tax plan. And now, five

225
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:06,059
weeks before the election, he's saying that
his big, bold idea is "never mind." And the

226
00:17:06,059 --> 00:17:13,019
fact is that if you are lowering the rates
the way you describe, Governor, then it is

227
00:17:13,019 --> 00:17:17,549
not possible to come up with enough deductions
and loopholes that only affect high-income

228
00:17:17,549 --> 00:17:25,049
individuals to avoid either raising the deficit
or burdening the middle class. It's — it's

229
00:17:25,049 --> 00:17:27,049
math. It's arithmetic.

230
00:17:27,049 --> 00:17:32,850
Now, Governor Romney and I do share a deep
interest in encouraging small-business growth.

231
00:17:32,850 --> 00:17:40,549
So at the same time that my tax plan has already
lowered taxes for 98 percent of families,

232
00:17:40,549 --> 00:17:48,570
I also lowered taxes for small businesses
18 times. And what I want to do is continue

233
00:17:48,570 --> 00:17:54,100
the tax rates — the tax cuts that we put
into place for small businesses and families.

234
00:17:54,100 --> 00:18:01,480
But I have said that for incomes over $250,000
a year that we should go back to the rates

235
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:05,259
that we had when Bill Clinton was president,
when we created 23 million new jobs, went

236
00:18:05,259 --> 00:18:09,620
from deficit to surplus and created a whole
lot of millionaires to boot.

237
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:13,889
And the reason this is important is because
by doing that, we can not only reduce the

238
00:18:13,889 --> 00:18:19,299
deficit, we can not only encourage job growth
through small businesses, but we're also able

239
00:18:19,299 --> 00:18:24,480
to make the investments that are necessary
in education or in energy.

240
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:28,110
And we do have a difference, though, when
it comes to definitions of small business.

241
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:33,879
Now, under — under my plan, 97 percent of
small businesses would not see their income

242
00:18:33,879 --> 00:18:39,240
taxes go up. Governor Romney says, well, those
top 3 percent, they're the job creators. They'd

243
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:40,860
be burdened.

244
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:45,620
But under Governor Romney's definition, there
are a whole bunch of millionaires and billionaires

245
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:49,899
who are small businesses. Donald Trump is
a small business. And I know Donald Trump

246
00:18:49,899 --> 00:18:55,750
doesn't like to think of himself as small
anything, but — but that's how you define

247
00:18:55,750 --> 00:19:01,539
small businesses if you're getting business
income. And that kind of approach, I believe,

248
00:19:01,539 --> 00:19:06,070
will not grow our economy because the only
way to pay for it without either burdening

249
00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:15,870
the middle class or blowing up our deficit
is to make drastic cuts in things like education,

250
00:19:15,870 --> 00:19:21,090
making sure that we are continuing to invest
in basic science and research, all the things

251
00:19:21,090 --> 00:19:23,639
that are helping America grow. And I think
that would be a mistake.

252
00:19:23,639 --> 00:19:24,539
MR. LEHRER: All right.

253
00:19:24,539 --> 00:19:26,769
MR. ROMNEY: Jim, let me just come back on
that — on that point.

254
00:19:26,769 --> 00:19:28,269
MR. LEHRER: Just for the — just for the
record —

255
00:19:28,269 --> 00:19:29,549
MR. ROMNEY: These small businesses we're talking
about —

256
00:19:29,549 --> 00:19:31,690
MR. LEHRER: Excuse me. Just so everybody understands
—

257
00:19:31,690 --> 00:19:31,929
MR. ROMNEY: Yeah.

258
00:19:31,929 --> 00:19:34,149
MR. LEHRER: — we're way over our first 15
minutes.

259
00:19:34,149 --> 00:19:35,200
MR. ROMNEY: It's fun, isn't it?

260
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,250
MR. LEHRER: It's OK. It's great.

261
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:36,960
PRESIDENT OBAMA: That's OK.

262
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,450
MR. LEHRER: No problem. No, you don't have
— you don't have a problem, I don't have

263
00:19:39,450 --> 00:19:43,340
a problem, because we're still on the economy,
but we're going to come back to taxes and

264
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:46,269
we're going to move on to the deficit and
a lot of other things, too.

265
00:19:46,269 --> 00:19:47,149
OK, but go ahead, sir.

266
00:19:47,149 --> 00:19:48,039
MR. ROMNEY: You bet.

267
00:19:48,039 --> 00:19:52,230
Well, President, you're — Mr. President,
you're absolutely right, which is that with

268
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:56,580
regards to 97 percent of the businesses are
not — not taxed at the 35 percent tax rate,

269
00:19:56,580 --> 00:20:01,149
they're taxed at a lower rate. But those businesses
that are in the last 3 percent of businesses

270
00:20:01,149 --> 00:20:06,710
happen to employ half — half — of all
of the people who work in small business.

271
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:11,580
Those are the businesses that employ one quarter
of all the workers in America. And your plan

272
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:15,370
is take their tax rate from 35 percent to
40 percent.

273
00:20:15,370 --> 00:20:19,779
Now, I talked to a guy who has a very small
business. He's in the electronics business

274
00:20:19,779 --> 00:20:22,340
in — in St. Louis. He has four employees.

275
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:26,860
He said he and his son calculated how much
they pay in taxes. Federal income tax, federal

276
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:31,769
payroll tax, state income tax, state sales
tax, state property tax, gasoline tax — it

277
00:20:31,769 --> 00:20:34,999
added up to well over 50 percent of what they
earned.

278
00:20:34,999 --> 00:20:42,600
And your plan is to take the tax rate on successful
small businesses from 35 percent to 40 percent.

279
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:49,399
The National Federation of Independent Businesses
has said that will cost 700,000 jobs. I don't

280
00:20:49,399 --> 00:20:56,600
want to cost jobs. My priority is jobs. And
so what I do is I bring down the tax rates,

281
00:20:56,600 --> 00:21:00,769
lower deductions and exemptions — the same
idea behind Bowles-Simpson, by the way. Get

282
00:21:00,769 --> 00:21:05,909
the rates down, lower deductions and exemptions
to create more jobs, because there's nothing

283
00:21:05,909 --> 00:21:10,830
better for getting us to a balanced budget
than having more people working, earning more

284
00:21:10,830 --> 00:21:14,860
money, paying — (chuckles) — more taxes.
That's by far the most effective and efficient

285
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:17,230
way to get this budget balanced.

286
00:21:17,230 --> 00:21:20,659
PRESIDENT OBAMA: Jim, I — you may want to
move on to another topic, but I would just

287
00:21:20,659 --> 00:21:28,190
say this to the American people. If you believe
that we can cut taxes by $5 trillion and add

288
00:21:28,190 --> 00:21:34,909
$2 trillion in additional spending that the
military is not asking for — $7 trillion,

289
00:21:34,909 --> 00:21:41,330
just to give you a sense, over 10 years that's
more than our entire defense budget — and

290
00:21:41,330 --> 00:21:46,700
you think that by closing loopholes and deductions
for the well-to-do, somehow you will not end

291
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:52,309
up picking up the tab, then Governor Romney's
plan may work for you.

292
00:21:52,309 --> 00:21:59,940
But I think math, common sense and our history
shows us that's not a recipe for job growth.

293
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:06,249
Look, we've tried this — we've tried both
approaches. The approach that Governor Romney's

294
00:22:06,249 --> 00:22:13,929
talking about is the same sales pitch that
was made in 2001 and 2003. And we ended up

295
00:22:13,929 --> 00:22:21,419
with the slowest job growth in 50 years. We
ended up moving from surplus to deficits.

296
00:22:21,419 --> 00:22:25,850
And it all culminated in the worst financial
crisis since the Great Depression.

297
00:22:25,850 --> 00:22:30,950
Bill Clinton tried the approach that I'm talking
about. We created 23 million new jobs. We

298
00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:37,639
went from deficit to surplus, and businesses
did very well.

299
00:22:37,639 --> 00:22:42,730
So in some ways, we've got some data on which
approach is more likely to create jobs and

300
00:22:42,730 --> 00:22:48,600
opportunity for Americans, and I believe that
the economy works best when middle-class families

301
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:52,830
are getting tax breaks so that they've got
some money in their pockets and those of us

302
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:58,110
who have done extraordinarily well because
of this magnificent country that we live in,

303
00:22:58,110 --> 00:23:01,499
that we can afford to do a little bit more
to make sure we're not blowing up the deficit.

304
00:23:01,499 --> 00:23:02,139
MR. LEHRER: OK. (Inaudible) —

305
00:23:02,139 --> 00:23:05,679
MR. ROMNEY: Jim, the president began this
segment, so I think I get the last word, so

306
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:06,070
I'm going to take it. All right? (Chuckles.)

307
00:23:06,070 --> 00:23:07,629
MR. LEHRER: Well, you're going to get the
first word in the next segment.

308
00:23:07,629 --> 00:23:10,240
MR. ROMNEY: Well, but — but he gets the
first word of that segment. I get the last

309
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,330
word of that segment, I hope. Let me just
make this comment.

310
00:23:11,330 --> 00:23:12,379
PRESIDENT OBAMA: (Chuckles.) He can — you
can have it. He can —

311
00:23:12,379 --> 00:23:13,179
MR. ROMNEY: First of all —

312
00:23:13,179 --> 00:23:14,299
MR. LEHRER: That's not how it works.

313
00:23:14,299 --> 00:23:16,830
MR. ROMNEY: Let me — let me repeat — let
me repeat what I said — (inaudible). I'm

314
00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:22,240
not in favor of a $5 trillion tax cut. That's
not my plan. My plan is not to put in place

315
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:26,330
any tax cut that will add to the deficit.
That's point one. So you may keep referring

316
00:23:26,330 --> 00:23:29,389
to it as a $5 trillion tax cut, but that's
not my plan.

317
00:23:29,389 --> 00:23:29,779
PRESIDENT OBAMA: OK.

318
00:23:29,779 --> 00:23:34,710
MR. ROMNEY: Number two, let's look at history.
My plan is not like anything that's been tried

319
00:23:34,710 --> 00:23:39,389
before. My plan is to bring down rates but
also bring down deductions and exemptions

320
00:23:39,389 --> 00:23:44,369
and credits at the same time so the revenue
stays in, but that we bring down rates to

321
00:23:44,369 --> 00:23:49,460
get more people working. My priority is putting
people back to work in America. They're suffering

322
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:54,279
in this country. And we talk about evidence
— look at the evidence of the last four

323
00:23:54,279 --> 00:24:00,460
years. It's absolutely extraordinary. We've
got 23 million people out of work or stop

324
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:01,610
looking for work in this country.

325
00:24:01,610 --> 00:24:02,210
MR. LEHRER: All right.

326
00:24:02,210 --> 00:24:05,720
MR. ROMNEY: It's just — it's — we've got
— we got — when the president took office,

327
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:10,919
32 million people on food stamps; 47 million
on food stamps today. Economic growth this

328
00:24:10,919 --> 00:24:16,039
year slower than last year, and last year
slower than the year before. Going forward

329
00:24:16,039 --> 00:24:19,889
with the status quo is not going to cut it
for the American people who are struggling

330
00:24:19,889 --> 00:24:20,169
today.

331
00:24:20,169 --> 00:24:24,690
MR. LEHRER: All right. Let's talk — we're
still on the economy. This is, theoretically

332
00:24:24,690 --> 00:24:32,350
now, a second segment still on the economy,
and specifically on what do about the federal

333
00:24:32,350 --> 00:24:38,110
deficit, the federal debt. And the question
— you each have two minutes on this — and,

334
00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:43,080
Governor Romney you go first because the president
went first on segment one. And the question

335
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:48,759
is this: What are the differences between
the two of you as to how you would go about

336
00:24:48,759 --> 00:24:50,649
tackling the deficit problem in this country?

337
00:24:50,649 --> 00:24:54,659
MR. ROMNEY: Well, good. I'm glad you raised
that. And it's a — it's a critical issue.

338
00:24:54,659 --> 00:25:00,539
I think it's not just an economic issue. I
think it's a moral issue. I think it's, frankly,

339
00:25:00,539 --> 00:25:05,340
not moral for my generation to keep spending
massively more than we take in, knowing those

340
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:08,980
burdens are going to be passed on to the next
generation. And they're going to be paying

341
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:13,179
the interest and the principle all their lives.
And the amount of debt we're adding, at a

342
00:25:13,179 --> 00:25:15,950
trillion a year, is simply not moral.

343
00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:19,940
So how do we deal with it? Well, mathematically
there are — there are three ways that you

344
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:26,110
can cut a deficit. One, of course, is to raise
taxes. Number two is to cut spending. And

345
00:25:26,110 --> 00:25:30,649
number three is to grow the economy because
if more people work in a growing economy they're

346
00:25:30,649 --> 00:25:33,570
paying taxes and you can get the job done
that way.

347
00:25:33,570 --> 00:25:37,499
The presidents would — president would prefer
raising taxes. I understand. The problem with

348
00:25:37,499 --> 00:25:41,799
raising taxes is that it slows down the rate
of growth and you could never quite get the

349
00:25:41,799 --> 00:25:46,539
job done. I want to lower spending and encourage
economic growth at the same time.

350
00:25:46,539 --> 00:25:50,539
What things would I cut from spending? Well,
first of all, I will eliminate all programs

351
00:25:50,539 --> 00:25:55,340
by this test — if they don't pass it: Is
the program so critical it's worth borrowing

352
00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:59,749
money from China to pay for it? And if not,
I'll get rid of it. "Obamacare" is on my list.

353
00:25:59,749 --> 00:26:02,590
I apologize, Mr. President. I use that term
with all respect.

354
00:26:02,590 --> 00:26:03,289
PRESIDENT OBAMA: I like it.

355
00:26:03,289 --> 00:26:07,169
MR. ROMNEY: Good. OK, good. (Laughter.) So
I'll get rid of that. I'm sorry, Jim. I'm

356
00:26:07,169 --> 00:26:11,549
going to stop the subsidy to PBS. I'm going
to stop other things. I like PBS. I love Big

357
00:26:11,549 --> 00:26:15,019
Bird. I actually like you too. But I'm not
going to — I'm not going to keep on spending

358
00:26:15,019 --> 00:26:18,490
money on things to borrow money from China
to pay for it. That's number one.

359
00:26:18,490 --> 00:26:22,919
Number two, I'll take programs that are currently
good programs but I think could be run more

360
00:26:22,919 --> 00:26:26,440
efficiently at the state level and send them
to state.

361
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:30,369
Number three, I'll make government more efficient,
and to cut back the number of employees, combine

362
00:26:30,369 --> 00:26:35,350
some agencies and departments. My cutbacks
will be done through attrition, by the way.

363
00:26:35,350 --> 00:26:39,509
This is the approach we have to take to get
America to a balanced budget. The president

364
00:26:39,509 --> 00:26:45,200
said he'd cut the deficit in half. Unfortunately,
he doubled it. Trillion-dollar deficits for

365
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:50,799
the last four years. The president's put it
in place as much public debt — almost as

366
00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:54,139
much debt held by by the public as all prior
presidents combined.

367
00:26:54,139 --> 00:26:56,039
MR. LEHRER: Mr. President. two minutes.

368
00:26:56,039 --> 00:27:00,999
PRESIDENT OBAMA: When I walked in the Oval
Office, I had more than a trillion dollar

369
00:27:00,999 --> 00:27:06,549
deficit greeting me, and we know where it
came from. Two wars that were paid for on

370
00:27:06,549 --> 00:27:13,100
a credit card. Two tax cuts that were not
paid for, and a whole bunch of programs that

371
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:19,139
were not paid for. And then a massive economic
crisis.

372
00:27:19,139 --> 00:27:24,549
And despite that, what we've said is, yes,
we had to take some initial emergency measures

373
00:27:24,549 --> 00:27:30,139
to make sure we didn't slip into a Great Depression.
But what we've also said is, let's make sure

374
00:27:30,139 --> 00:27:33,330
that we are cutting out those things that
are not helping us grow.

375
00:27:33,330 --> 00:27:39,149
So, 77 government programs — everything
from aircrafts that the Air Force had ordered

376
00:27:39,149 --> 00:27:45,090
but weren't working very well. Eighteen government
— 18 government programs for education that

377
00:27:45,090 --> 00:27:52,100
were well- intentioned but weren't helping
kids learn. We went after medical fraud in

378
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:56,820
Medicare and Medicaid very aggressively — more
aggressively than ever before, and have saved

379
00:27:56,820 --> 00:28:01,009
tens of billions of dollars. Fifty billion
dollars of waste taken out of the system.

380
00:28:01,009 --> 00:28:06,519
And I worked with Democrats and Republicans
to cut a trillion dollars out of our discretionary

381
00:28:06,519 --> 00:28:11,700
domestic budget. That's the largest cut in
the discretionary domestic budget since Dwight

382
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:12,590
Eisenhower.

383
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:18,369
Now, we all know that we've got to do more.
And so I've put forward a specific $4 trillion

384
00:28:18,369 --> 00:28:21,019
deficit-reduction plan.

385
00:28:21,019 --> 00:28:26,049
It's on a website. You can look at all the
numbers, what cuts we make and what revenue

386
00:28:26,049 --> 00:28:27,610
we raise.

387
00:28:27,610 --> 00:28:34,989
And the way we do it is $2.50 for every cut,
we ask for a dollar of additional revenue,

388
00:28:34,989 --> 00:28:39,570
paid for, as I indicated earlier, by asking
those of us who have done very well in this

389
00:28:39,570 --> 00:28:42,519
country to contribute a little bit more to
reduce the deficit.

390
00:28:42,519 --> 00:28:47,940
And Governor Romney earlier mentioned the
Bowles-Simpson commission. Well, that's how

391
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:52,580
the commission — bipartisan commission that
talked about how we should move forward suggested

392
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:58,519
we have to do it — in a balanced way with
some revenue and some spending cuts. And this

393
00:28:58,519 --> 00:29:00,720
is a major difference that Governor Romney
and I have.

394
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:05,450
Let — let me just finish this point because
you're looking for contrast. You know, when

395
00:29:05,450 --> 00:29:11,820
Governor Romney stood on a stage with other
Republican candidates for the nomination,

396
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:22,799
and he was asked, would you take $10 of spending
cuts for just $1 of revenue, and he said no.

397
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:28,489
Now, if you take such an unbalanced approach,
then that means you are going to be gutting

398
00:29:28,489 --> 00:29:34,059
our investments in schools and education.
It means that — Governor Romney talked about

399
00:29:34,059 --> 00:29:38,570
Medicaid and how we could send it back to
the states, but effectively this means a 30

400
00:29:38,570 --> 00:29:43,269
percent cut in the primary program we help
for seniors who are in nursing homes, for

401
00:29:43,269 --> 00:29:44,749
kids who are with disabilities —

402
00:29:44,749 --> 00:29:45,470
MR. LEHRER: Mr. President, I'm sorry —

403
00:29:45,470 --> 00:29:48,309
PRESIDENT OBAMA: And that is not a right strategy
for us to move forward.

404
00:29:48,309 --> 00:29:49,590
MR. LEHRER: Way over the two minutes.

405
00:29:49,590 --> 00:29:50,399
PRESIDENT OBAMA: Sorry.

406
00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:53,529
MR. LEHRER: Governor, what about Simpson-Bowles.
Will you support Simpson-Bowles?

407
00:29:53,529 --> 00:29:56,299
MR. ROMNEY: Simpson-Bowles, the president
should have grabbed that.

408
00:29:56,299 --> 00:29:57,899
MR. LEHRER: No, I mean do you support Simpson-Bowles?

409
00:29:57,899 --> 00:30:02,100
MR. ROMNEY: I have my own plan. It's not the
same as Simpson- Bowles. But in my view, the

410
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:05,639
president should have grabbed it. If you wanted
to make some adjustments to it, take it, go

411
00:30:05,639 --> 00:30:07,080
to Congress, fight for it.

412
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:09,820
PRESIDENT OBAMA: That's what we've done, made
some adjustments to it; and we're putting

413
00:30:09,820 --> 00:30:11,950
it forward before Congress right now, a $4
trillion plan, (a balanced ?) —

414
00:30:11,950 --> 00:30:14,119
MR. ROMNEY: But you've been — but you've
been president four years. You've been president

415
00:30:14,119 --> 00:30:17,889
four years. You said you'd cut the deficit
in half. It's now four years later. We still

416
00:30:17,889 --> 00:30:19,190
have trillion- dollar deficits.

417
00:30:19,190 --> 00:30:23,480
The CBO says we'll have a trillion-dollar
deficit each of the next four years. If you're

418
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:28,200
re-elected, we'll get to a trillion-dollar
debt. You have said before you'd cut the deficit

419
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:31,940
in half. And this four — I love this idea
of 4 trillion (dollars) in cuts. You've found

420
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:36,070
$4 trillion of ways to reduce or to get closer
to a balanced budget, except we still show

421
00:30:36,070 --> 00:30:39,919
trillion dollar deficits every year. That
doesn't get the job done.

422
00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:45,399
Let me come back and say, why is that I don't
want to raise taxes? Why don't I want to raise

423
00:30:45,399 --> 00:30:51,179
taxes on people? And actually, you said it
back in 2010. You said, look, I'm going to

424
00:30:51,179 --> 00:30:55,509
extend the tax policies that we have. Now,
I'm not going to raise taxes on anyone because

425
00:30:55,509 --> 00:30:59,049
when the economy's growing slow like this,
when we're in recession you shouldn't raise

426
00:30:59,049 --> 00:31:00,649
taxes on anyone.

427
00:31:00,649 --> 00:31:05,029
Well, the economy is still growing slow. As
a matter of fact, it's growing much more slowly

428
00:31:05,029 --> 00:31:09,169
now than when you made that statement. And
so if you believe the same thing, you just

429
00:31:09,169 --> 00:31:13,799
don't want to raise taxes on people. And the
reality is it's not just wealthy people — you

430
00:31:13,799 --> 00:31:17,749
mentioned Donald Trump — it's not just Donald
Trump you're taxing; it's all those businesses

431
00:31:17,749 --> 00:31:21,999
that employ one-quarter of the workers in
America. These small businesses that are taxed

432
00:31:21,999 --> 00:31:27,369
as individuals. You raise taxes and you kill
jobs. That's why the National Federation of

433
00:31:27,369 --> 00:31:32,970
Independent Businesses said your plan will
kill 700,000 jobs. I don't want to kill jobs

434
00:31:32,970 --> 00:31:33,539
in this environment.

435
00:31:33,539 --> 00:31:36,330
Let me make one more point. And that's — and
that —

436
00:31:36,330 --> 00:31:37,940
MR. LEHRER: Let's let him answer the taxes
thing for a moment, OK?

437
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:38,730
MR. ROMNEY: OK.

438
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:39,799
MR. LEHRER: Mr. President.

439
00:31:39,799 --> 00:31:41,850
PRESIDENT OBAMA: Well, we've had this discussion
before.

440
00:31:41,850 --> 00:31:47,749
MR. LEHRER: No, about the idea that in order
to reduce the deficit there has to be revenue

441
00:31:47,749 --> 00:31:48,850
in addition to cuts.

442
00:31:48,850 --> 00:31:51,950
PRESIDENT OBAMA: There has to be revenue in
addition to cuts. Now, Governor Romney has

443
00:31:51,950 --> 00:31:53,960
ruled out revenue. He's — he's ruled out
revenue.

444
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:55,009
MR. LEHRER: That's true, right?

445
00:31:55,009 --> 00:31:55,639
MR. ROMNEY: Absolutely.

446
00:31:55,639 --> 00:31:56,480
PRESIDENT OBAMA: OK, so —

447
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:57,109
MR. LEHRER: Completely?

448
00:31:57,109 --> 00:32:01,580
MR. ROMNEY: I — look, the revenue I get
is by more people working, getting higher

449
00:32:01,580 --> 00:32:05,879
pay, paying more taxes. That's how we get
growth and how we balance the budget. But

450
00:32:05,879 --> 00:32:10,820
the idea of taxing people more, putting more
people out of work — you'll never get there.

451
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:14,139
You never balance the budget by raising taxes.

452
00:32:14,139 --> 00:32:19,299
Spain — Spain spends 42 percent of their
total economy on government. We're now spending

453
00:32:19,299 --> 00:32:21,320
42 percent of our economy on government.

454
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:25,320
I don't want to go down the path to Spain.
I want to go down the path of growth that

455
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:29,200
puts Americans to work, with more money coming
in because they're working.

456
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,200
MR. LEHRER: Yeah.

457
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:34,970
But Mr. President, you're saying in order
to get it — the job done, it's got to be

458
00:32:34,970 --> 00:32:35,769
balanced. You've got to have —

459
00:32:35,769 --> 00:32:39,039
PRESIDENT OBAMA: If we're serious, we've got
to take a balanced, responsible approach.

460
00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:43,090
And by the way, this is not just when it comes
to individual taxes.

461
00:32:43,090 --> 00:32:50,649
Let's talk about corporate taxes. Now, I've
identified areas where we can, right away,

462
00:32:50,649 --> 00:32:54,749
make a change that I believe would actually
help the economy. The — the oil industry

463
00:32:54,749 --> 00:33:01,940
gets $4 billion a year in corporate welfare.
Basically, they get deductions that those

464
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:07,609
small businesses that Governor Romney refers
to, they don't get. Now, does anybody think

465
00:33:07,609 --> 00:33:14,559
that ExxonMobil needs some extra money when
they're making money every time you go to

466
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:18,820
the pump? Why wouldn't we want to eliminate
that?

467
00:33:18,820 --> 00:33:24,609
Why wouldn't we eliminate tax breaks for corporate
jets? My attitude is if you got a corporate

468
00:33:24,609 --> 00:33:29,700
jet, you can probably afford to pay full freight,
not get a special break for it.

469
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:34,419
When it comes to corporate taxes, Governor
Romney has said he wants to, in a revenue-neutral

470
00:33:34,419 --> 00:33:40,960
way, close loopholes, deductions — he hasn't
identified which ones they are — but thereby

471
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:46,559
bring down the corporate rate. Well, I want
to do the same thing, but I've actually identified

472
00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:48,109
how we can do that.

473
00:33:48,109 --> 00:33:52,769
And part of the way to do it is to not give
tax breaks to companies that are shipping

474
00:33:52,769 --> 00:33:59,830
jobs overseas. Right now you can actually
take a deduction for moving a plant overseas.

475
00:33:59,830 --> 00:34:04,730
I think most Americans would say that doesn't
make sense. And all that raises revenue.

476
00:34:04,730 --> 00:34:11,560
And so if we take a balanced approach, what
that then allows us to do is also to help

477
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:15,370
young people, the way we already have during
my administration, make sure that they can

478
00:34:15,370 --> 00:34:20,610
afford to go to college. It means that the
teacher that I met in Las Vegas, wonderful

479
00:34:20,610 --> 00:34:25,840
young lady, who describes to me — she's
got 42 kids in her class.

480
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:30,990
The first two weeks, she's got them — some
of them sitting on the floor until finally

481
00:34:30,990 --> 00:34:36,679
they get reassigned. They're using textbooks
that are 10 years old. That is not a recipe

482
00:34:36,679 --> 00:34:39,810
for growth; that's not how America was built.

483
00:34:39,810 --> 00:34:44,450
And so budgets reflect choices. Ultimately
we're going to have to make some decisions.

484
00:34:44,450 --> 00:34:49,400
And if we're asking for no revenue, then that
means that we've got to get rid of a whole

485
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:54,710
bunch of stuff, and the magnitude of the tax
cuts that you're talking about, Governor,

486
00:34:54,710 --> 00:35:00,950
would end up resulting in severe hardship
for people, but more importantly, would not

487
00:35:00,950 --> 00:35:01,770
help us grow.

488
00:35:01,770 --> 00:35:06,120
As I indicated before, when you talk about
shifting Medicaid to states, we're talking

489
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:13,180
about potentially a — a 30 — a 30 percent
cut in Medicaid over time. Now, you know,

490
00:35:13,180 --> 00:35:20,280
that may not seem like a big deal when it
just is — you know, numbers on a sheet of

491
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:24,430
paper, but if we're talking about a family
who's got an autistic kid and is depending

492
00:35:24,430 --> 00:35:29,120
on that Medicaid, that's a big problem. And
governors are creative. There's no doubt about

493
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:33,640
it. But they're not creative enough to make
up for 30 percent of revenue on something

494
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:37,920
like Medicaid. What ends up happening is some
people end up not getting help.

495
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:41,630
MR. ROMNEY: Jim, let's — we — we've gone
on a lot of topics there, and — so I've

496
00:35:41,630 --> 00:35:44,700
got to take — it's going to take a minute
to go from Medicaid to schools to —

497
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:45,070
PRESIDENT OBAMA: (Inaudible.)

498
00:35:45,070 --> 00:35:45,950
MR. LEHRER: Come back to Medicaid, here, yeah,
yeah, right.

499
00:35:45,950 --> 00:35:48,450
MR. ROMNEY: — oil to tax breaks and companies
overseas. So let's go through them one by

500
00:35:48,450 --> 00:35:53,430
one. First of all, the Department of Energy
has said the tax break for oil companies is

501
00:35:53,430 --> 00:35:57,310
$2.8 billion a year. And it's actually an
accounting treatment, as you know, that's

502
00:35:57,310 --> 00:35:59,740
been in place for a hundred years. Now —

503
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:00,180
PRESIDENT OBAMA: It's time to end it.

504
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:07,730
MR. ROMNEY: And — and in one year, you provided
$90 billion in breaks to the green energy

505
00:36:07,730 --> 00:36:13,580
world. Now, I like green energy as well, but
that's about 50 years' worth of what oil and

506
00:36:13,580 --> 00:36:18,340
gas receives, and you say Exxon and Mobil
— actually, this $2.8 billion goes largely

507
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:20,890
to small companies, to drilling operators
and so forth.

508
00:36:20,890 --> 00:36:25,930
But you know, if we get that tax rate from
35 percent down to 25 percent, why, that $2.8

509
00:36:25,930 --> 00:36:29,260
billion is on the table. Of course it's on
the table. That's probably not going to survive,

510
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:31,860
you get that rate down to 25 percent.

511
00:36:31,860 --> 00:36:38,550
But — but don't forget, you put $90 billion
— like 50 years worth of breaks — into

512
00:36:38,550 --> 00:36:44,660
solar and wind, to — to Solyndra and Fisker
and Tesla and Ener1. I mean, I — I had a

513
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:48,060
friend who said, you don't just pick the winners
and losers; you pick the losers. All right?

514
00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:52,420
So — so this is not — this is not the
kind of policy you want to have if you want

515
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:54,190
to get America energy-secure.

516
00:36:54,190 --> 00:36:58,120
The second topic, which is you said you get
a deduction for getting a plant overseas.

517
00:36:58,120 --> 00:37:03,270
Look, I've been in business for 25 years.
I have no idea what you're talking about.

518
00:37:03,270 --> 00:37:04,900
I maybe need to get a new accountant.

519
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:05,360
MR. LEHRER: Let's —

520
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:08,510
MR. ROMNEY: But the — the idea that you
get a break for shipping jobs overseas is

521
00:37:08,510 --> 00:37:09,320
simply not the case.

522
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:09,810
MR. LEHRER: Let's have —

523
00:37:09,810 --> 00:37:11,810
MR. ROMNEY: What we do have right now is a
setting —

524
00:37:11,810 --> 00:37:11,900
MR. LEHRER: Excuse me.

525
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:14,490
MR. ROMNEY: — where I'd like to bring money
from overseas back to this country.

526
00:37:14,490 --> 00:37:18,710
And finally, Medicaid to states, I'm not quite
sure where that came in, except this, which

527
00:37:18,710 --> 00:37:23,610
is, I would like to take the Medicaid dollars
that go to states and say to a state, you're

528
00:37:23,610 --> 00:37:29,220
going to get what you got last year plus inflation
— inflation — plus 1 percent. And then

529
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:32,480
you're going to manage your care for your
poor in the way you think best.

530
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:38,520
And I remember as a governor, when this idea
was floated by Tommy Thompson, the governors,

531
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:43,510
Republican and Democrats, said, please let
us do that. We can care for our own poor in

532
00:37:43,510 --> 00:37:48,060
so much better and more effective a way than
having the federal government tell us how

533
00:37:48,060 --> 00:37:50,360
to care for our poor.

534
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:54,680
So let states — one of the magnificent things
about this country is the whole idea that

535
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:58,970
states are the laboratories of democracy.
Don't have the federal government tell everybody

536
00:37:58,970 --> 00:38:03,160
what kind of training programs they have to
have and what kind of Medicaid they have to

537
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:04,820
have. Let states do this.

538
00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:07,600
And by the way, if a states get — gets in
trouble, why, we could step in and see if

539
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:09,080
we could find a way to help them. But —

540
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:09,420
MR. LEHRER: Let's go.

541
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:13,140
MR. ROMNEY: But — but the right — the
right approach is one which relies on the

542
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:13,470
brilliance —

543
00:38:13,470 --> 00:38:13,470
MR. LEHRER: Two seconds.

544
00:38:13,470 --> 00:38:15,310
MR. ROMNEY: — of our people and states,
not the federal government.

545
00:38:15,310 --> 00:38:18,240
MR. LEHRER: Two seconds and we're going on,
still on the economy on another — but another

546
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:19,450
part of it.

547
00:38:19,450 --> 00:38:19,930
PRESIDENT OBAMA: OK.

548
00:38:19,930 --> 00:38:25,020
MR. LEHRER: All right? All right, this is
this is segment three, the economy, entitlements.

549
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:31,030
First answer goes to you. It's two minutes.
Mr. President, do you see a major difference

550
00:38:31,030 --> 00:38:32,930
between the two of you on Social Security?

551
00:38:32,930 --> 00:38:39,000
PRESIDENT OBAMA: You know, I suspect that
on Social Security, we've got a somewhat similar

552
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:43,470
position. Social Security is structurally
sound. It's going to have to be tweaked the

553
00:38:43,470 --> 00:38:50,110
way it was by Ronald Reagan and Speaker — Democratic
Speaker Tip O'Neill. But it is — the basic

554
00:38:50,110 --> 00:38:55,250
structure is sound. But — but I want to
talk about the values behind Social Security

555
00:38:55,250 --> 00:38:59,250
and Medicare and then talk about Medicare,
because that's the big driver —

556
00:38:59,250 --> 00:38:59,850
MR. LEHRER: Sure — it — you bet.

557
00:38:59,850 --> 00:39:01,970
PRESIDENT OBAMA: — of our deficits right
now.

558
00:39:01,970 --> 00:39:08,900
You know, my grandmother, some of you know,
helped to raise me. My grandparents did. My

559
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:14,310
grandfather died awhile back. My grandmother
died three days before I was elected president.

560
00:39:14,310 --> 00:39:17,940
And she was fiercely independent. She worked
her way up, only had a high school education,

561
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:24,850
started as a secretary, ended up being the
vice president of a local bank. And she ended

562
00:39:24,850 --> 00:39:30,290
up living alone by choice. And the reason
she could be independent was because of Social

563
00:39:30,290 --> 00:39:36,170
Security and Medicare. She had worked all
her life, put in this money and understood

564
00:39:36,170 --> 00:39:40,030
that there was a basic guarantee, a floor
under which she could not go.

565
00:39:40,030 --> 00:39:44,700
And that's the perspective I bring when I
think about what's called entitlements. You

566
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:49,700
know, the name itself implies some sense of
dependency on the part of these folks. These

567
00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:53,550
are folks who've worked hard, like my grandmother.
And there are millions of people out there

568
00:39:53,550 --> 00:39:55,550
who are counting on this.

569
00:39:55,550 --> 00:40:02,290
So my approach is to say, how do we strengthen
the system over the long term? And in Medicare,

570
00:40:02,290 --> 00:40:07,590
what we did was we said, we are going to have
to bring down the costs if we're going to

571
00:40:07,590 --> 00:40:12,370
deal with our long- term deficits, but to
do that, let's look where some of the money

572
00:40:12,370 --> 00:40:17,020
is going. Seven hundred and sixteen billion
dollars we were able to save from the Medicare

573
00:40:17,020 --> 00:40:23,510
program by no longer overpaying insurance
companies, by making sure that we weren't

574
00:40:23,510 --> 00:40:26,070
overpaying providers.

575
00:40:26,070 --> 00:40:29,780
And using that money, we were actually able
to lower prescription drug costs for seniors

576
00:40:29,780 --> 00:40:35,720
by an average of $600, and we were also able
to make a — make a significant dent in providing

577
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:39,780
them the kind of preventive care that will
ultimately save money through the — throughout

578
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:40,630
the system.

579
00:40:40,630 --> 00:40:46,090
So the way for us to deal with Medicare in
particular is to lower health care costs.

580
00:40:46,090 --> 00:40:51,930
But when it comes to Social Security, as I
said, you don't need a major structural change

581
00:40:51,930 --> 00:40:54,130
in order to make sure that Social Security
is there for the future.

582
00:40:54,130 --> 00:40:55,760
MR. LEHRER: We'll follow up on this.

583
00:40:55,760 --> 00:41:00,400
First, Governor Romney, you have two minutes
on Social Security and entitlements.

584
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:05,570
MR. ROMNEY: Well, Jim, our seniors depend
on these programs. And I know any time we

585
00:41:05,570 --> 00:41:09,210
talk about entitlements, people become concerned
that something's going to happen that's going

586
00:41:09,210 --> 00:41:14,070
to change their life for the worst, and the
answer is, neither the president nor I are

587
00:41:14,070 --> 00:41:20,180
proposing any changes for any current retirees
or near retirees, either to Social Security

588
00:41:20,180 --> 00:41:25,590
or Medicare. So if you're 60 or around 60
or older, you don't need to listen any further.

589
00:41:25,590 --> 00:41:29,020
But for younger people, we need to talk about
what changes are going to be occurring.

590
00:41:29,020 --> 00:41:33,170
Oh, I just thought about one, and that is
in fact I was wrong when I said the president

591
00:41:33,170 --> 00:41:37,700
isn't proposing any changes for current retirees.
In fact, he is on Medicare. On Social Security,

592
00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:38,680
he's not.

593
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:45,670
But on Medicare, for current retirees he's
cutting $716 billion from the program. Now,

594
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:50,710
he says by not overpaying hospitals and providers,
actually just going to them and saying we're

595
00:41:50,710 --> 00:41:54,950
going to reduce the rates you get paid across
the board, everybody's going to get a lower

596
00:41:54,950 --> 00:41:57,960
rate. That's not just going after places where
there's abuse, that's saying we're cutting

597
00:41:57,960 --> 00:42:02,670
the rates. Some 15 percent of hospitals and
nursing homes say they won't take anymore

598
00:42:02,670 --> 00:42:05,350
Medicare patients under that scenario.

599
00:42:05,350 --> 00:42:11,170
We also have 50 percent of doctors who say
they won't take more Medicare patients. This

600
00:42:11,170 --> 00:42:15,920
— we have 4 million people on Medicare Advantage
that will lose Medicare Advantage because

601
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:24,230
of those $716 billion in cuts. I can't understand
how you can cut Medicare $716 billion for

602
00:42:24,230 --> 00:42:26,390
current recipients of Medicare.

603
00:42:26,390 --> 00:42:29,290
Now, you point out, well, we're putting some
back; we're going to give a better prescription

604
00:42:29,290 --> 00:42:34,910
program. That's one — that's $1 for every
15 (dollars) you've cut. They're smart enough

605
00:42:34,910 --> 00:42:36,980
to know that's not a good trade.

606
00:42:36,980 --> 00:42:42,490
I want to take that $716 billion you've cut
and put it back into Medicare. By the way,

607
00:42:42,490 --> 00:42:46,980
we can include a prescription program if we
need to improve it, but the idea of cutting

608
00:42:46,980 --> 00:42:52,210
$716 billion from Medicare to be able to balance
the additional cost of "Obamacare" is, in

609
00:42:52,210 --> 00:42:56,990
my opinion, a mistake. And with regards to
young people coming along, I've got proposals

610
00:42:56,990 --> 00:43:01,430
to make sure Medicare and Social Security
are there for them without any question.

611
00:43:01,430 --> 00:43:03,060
MR. LEHRER: Mr. President.

612
00:43:03,060 --> 00:43:07,200
PRESIDENT OBAMA: First of all, I think it's
important for Governor Romney to present this

613
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:13,450
plan that he says will only affect folks in
the future. And the essence of the plan is

614
00:43:13,450 --> 00:43:20,020
that he would turn Medicare into a voucher
program. It's called premium support, but

615
00:43:20,020 --> 00:43:23,020
it's understood to be a voucher program. His
running mate —

616
00:43:23,020 --> 00:43:23,910
MR. LEHRER: And you — and you don't support
that?

617
00:43:23,910 --> 00:43:26,040
PRESIDENT OBAMA: I don't. And — and let
me explain why.

618
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:28,250
MR. ROMNEY: Again, that's for future people
—

619
00:43:28,250 --> 00:43:28,780
PRESIDENT OBAMA: I understand.

620
00:43:28,780 --> 00:43:29,820
MR. ROMNEY: — right, not for current retirees.

621
00:43:29,820 --> 00:43:33,500
PRESIDENT OBAMA: For — for — so if you're
— if you — you're 54 or 55, you might

622
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:39,410
want to listen, because this — this will
affect you. The idea, which was originally

623
00:43:39,410 --> 00:43:48,250
presented by Congressman Ryan, your running
mate, is that we would give a voucher to seniors,

624
00:43:48,250 --> 00:43:54,030
and they could go out in the private marketplace
and buy their own health insurance. The problem

625
00:43:54,030 --> 00:43:59,760
is that because the voucher wouldn't necessarily
keep up with health care inflation, it was

626
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:04,030
estimated that this would cost the average
senior about $6,000 a year.

627
00:44:04,030 --> 00:44:09,250
Now, in fairness, what Governor Romney has
now said is he'll maintain traditional Medicare

628
00:44:09,250 --> 00:44:15,250
alongside it. But there's still a problem,
because what happens is those insurance companies

629
00:44:15,250 --> 00:44:20,440
are pretty clever at figuring out who are
the younger and healthier seniors.

630
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:26,350
They recruit them leaving the older, sicker
seniors in Medicare. And every health care

631
00:44:26,350 --> 00:44:30,590
economist who looks at it says over time what'll
happen is the traditional Medicare system

632
00:44:30,590 --> 00:44:35,880
will collapse. And then what you've got is
folks like my grandmother at the mercy of

633
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:41,090
the private insurance system, precisely at
the time when they are most in need of decent

634
00:44:41,090 --> 00:44:42,120
health care.

635
00:44:42,120 --> 00:44:48,870
So I don't think vouchers are the right way
to go. And this is not my own — only my

636
00:44:48,870 --> 00:44:55,940
opinion. AARP thinks that the — the savings
that we obtained from Medicare bolster the

637
00:44:55,940 --> 00:45:02,180
system, lengthen the Medicare trust fund by
8 years. Benefits were not affected at all

638
00:45:02,180 --> 00:45:08,030
and ironically if you repeal "Obamacare" — and
I have become fond of this term, "Obamacare"

639
00:45:08,030 --> 00:45:12,730
— (laughter) — if you repeal it, what
happens is those seniors right away are going

640
00:45:12,730 --> 00:45:17,410
to be paying $600 more in prescription care.
They're now going to have to be paying copays

641
00:45:17,410 --> 00:45:21,400
for basic check-ups that can keep them healthier.

642
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:30,160
And the primary beneficiary of that repeal
are insurance companies that are estimated

643
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:35,200
to gain billions of dollars back when they
aren't making seniors any healthier. And I

644
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:40,150
— I don't think that's right approach when
it comes to making sure that Medicare is stronger

645
00:45:40,150 --> 00:45:40,800
over the long term.

646
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:44,800
MR. LEHRER: We'll talk about — specifically
about health care in a moment, but what is

647
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:46,640
— do you support the voucher system, Governor?

648
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:53,680
MR. ROMNEY: What I support is no change for
current retirees and near-retirees to Medicare

649
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:57,500
and the president supports taking $716 billion
out of that program.

650
00:45:57,500 --> 00:45:58,550
MR. LEHRER: What about the vouchers?

651
00:45:58,550 --> 00:45:59,510
MR. ROMNEY: So that's — that's number one.

652
00:45:59,510 --> 00:45:59,990
MR. LEHRER: OK. All right.

653
00:45:59,990 --> 00:46:04,220
MR. ROMNEY: Number two is for people coming
along that are young. What I'd do to make

654
00:46:04,220 --> 00:46:09,630
sure that we can keep Medicare in place for
them is to allow them either to choose the

655
00:46:09,630 --> 00:46:14,790
current Medicare program or a private plan
— their choice. They get to — and they'll

656
00:46:14,790 --> 00:46:19,270
have at least two plans that will be entirely
at no cost to them. So they don't have to

657
00:46:19,270 --> 00:46:22,200
pay additional money, no additional $6,000.
That's not going to happen.

658
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:23,310
They'll have at least two plans.

659
00:46:23,310 --> 00:46:27,490
And by the way, if the government can be as
efficient as the private sector and offer

660
00:46:27,490 --> 00:46:32,270
premiums that are as low as the private sector,
people will be happy to get traditional Medicare,

661
00:46:32,270 --> 00:46:36,200
or they'll be able to get a private plan.
I know my own view is I'd rather have a private

662
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:39,460
plan. I — I'd just as soon not have the
government telling me what kind of health

663
00:46:39,460 --> 00:46:42,760
care I get. I'd rather be able to have an
insurance company. If I don't like them, I

664
00:46:42,760 --> 00:46:46,190
can get rid of them and find a different insurance
company. But people will make their own choice.

665
00:46:46,190 --> 00:46:50,990
The other thing we have to do to save Medicare,
we have to have the benefits high for those

666
00:46:50,990 --> 00:46:55,080
that are low-income, but for higher-income
people, we're going to have to lower some

667
00:46:55,080 --> 00:46:59,130
of the benefits. We have to make sure this
program is there for the long term. That's

668
00:46:59,130 --> 00:47:00,130
the plan that I've put forward.

669
00:47:00,130 --> 00:47:04,200
And by the way, the idea came not even from
Paul Ryan or — or Senator Wyden, who's a

670
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:08,900
co-author of the bill with — with Paul Ryan
in the Senate, but also it came from Bill

671
00:47:08,900 --> 00:47:12,400
Clinton's — Bill Clinton's chief of staff.
This is an idea that's been around a long

672
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:17,250
time, which is saying, hey, let's see if we
can't get competition into the Medicare world

673
00:47:17,250 --> 00:47:22,920
so that people can get the choice of different
plans at lower cost, better quality. I believe

674
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:23,350
in competition.

675
00:47:23,350 --> 00:47:27,900
PRESIDENT OBAMA: Jim, if I — if I can just
respond very quickly, first of all, every

676
00:47:27,900 --> 00:47:33,140
study has shown that Medicare has lower administrative
cost than private insurance does, which is

677
00:47:33,140 --> 00:47:38,940
why seniors are generally pretty happy with
it. And private insurers have to make a profit.

678
00:47:38,940 --> 00:47:44,270
Nothing wrong with that; that's what they
do. And so you've got higher administrative

679
00:47:44,270 --> 00:47:52,000
costs, plus profit on top of that, and if
you are going to save any money through what

680
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:57,950
Governor Romney's proposing, what has to happen
is is that the money has to come from somewhere.

681
00:47:57,950 --> 00:48:03,580
And when you move to a voucher system, you
are putting seniors at the mercy of those

682
00:48:03,580 --> 00:48:11,470
insurance companies. And over time, if traditional
Medicare has decayed or fallen apart, then

683
00:48:11,470 --> 00:48:18,890
they're stuck. And this is the reason why
AARP has said that your plan would weaken

684
00:48:18,890 --> 00:48:24,810
Medicare substantially, and that's why they
were supportive of the approach that we took.

685
00:48:24,810 --> 00:48:29,450
One last point I want to make. We do have
to lower the cost of health care. Not just

686
00:48:29,450 --> 00:48:30,010
in Medicare and —

687
00:48:30,010 --> 00:48:30,960
MR. LEHRER: We'll talk about that in a minute.

688
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:31,830
PRESIDENT OBAMA: — but — but overall.

689
00:48:31,830 --> 00:48:33,050
MR. LEHRER: Go. OK.

690
00:48:33,050 --> 00:48:34,300
PRESIDENT OBAMA: And so —

691
00:48:34,300 --> 00:48:35,420
MR. ROMNEY: That's — that's a big topic.
Could we — could we stay on Medicare?

692
00:48:35,420 --> 00:48:35,530
PRESIDENT OBAMA: Is that a — is that a separate
topic? I'm sorry.

693
00:48:35,530 --> 00:48:38,930
MR. LEHRER: Yeah, we're going to — yeah.
I want to get to it, but all I want to do

694
00:48:38,930 --> 00:48:39,400
is very quickly —

695
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:40,490
MR. ROMNEY: Let's get back to Medicare.

696
00:48:40,490 --> 00:48:41,580
MR. LEHRER: — before we leave the economy
—

697
00:48:41,580 --> 00:48:42,350
MR. ROMNEY: Let's get back to Medicare.

698
00:48:42,350 --> 00:48:42,900
MR. LEHRER: No, no, no, no —

699
00:48:42,900 --> 00:48:46,290
MR. ROMNEY: The president said that the government
can provide the service at lower —

700
00:48:46,290 --> 00:48:46,290
MR. LEHRER: No.

701
00:48:46,290 --> 00:48:47,370
MR. ROMNEY: — cost and without a profit.

702
00:48:47,370 --> 00:48:47,840
MR. LEHRER: All right.

703
00:48:47,840 --> 00:48:51,370
MR. ROMNEY: If that's the case, then it will
always be the best product that people can

704
00:48:51,370 --> 00:48:53,280
purchase. But my experience —

705
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:53,300
MR. LEHRER: Wait a minute, Governor.

706
00:48:53,300 --> 00:48:56,920
MR. ROMNEY: My experience is the private sector
typically is able to provide a better product

707
00:48:56,920 --> 00:48:57,700
at a lower cost.

708
00:48:57,700 --> 00:49:02,490
MR. LEHRER: Can we — can the two of you
agree that the voters have a choice, a clear

709
00:49:02,490 --> 00:49:03,870
choice between the two of you —

710
00:49:03,870 --> 00:49:04,250
MR. ROMNEY: Absolutely.

711
00:49:04,250 --> 00:49:04,640
PRESIDENT OBAMA: Yes.

712
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:05,150
MR. LEHRER: — on Medicare?

713
00:49:05,150 --> 00:49:05,540
MR. ROMNEY: Absolutely.

714
00:49:05,540 --> 00:49:10,400
MR. LEHRER: All right. So, to finish quickly,
briefly, on the economy, what is your view

715
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:15,540
about the level of federal regulation of the
economy right now? Is there too much, and

716
00:49:15,540 --> 00:49:21,280
in your case, Mr. President, is there — should
there be more? Beginning with you — this

717
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:25,190
is not a new two-minute segment — to start,
and we'll go for a few minutes and then we're

718
00:49:25,190 --> 00:49:26,840
going to go to health care. OK?

719
00:49:26,840 --> 00:49:32,400
MR. ROMNEY: Regulation is essential. You can't
have a free market work if you don't have

720
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:36,600
regulation. As a business person, I had to
have — I needed to know the regulations.

721
00:49:36,600 --> 00:49:40,810
I needed them there. You couldn't have people
opening up banks in their — in their garage

722
00:49:40,810 --> 00:49:45,090
and making loans. I mean, you have to have
regulations so that you can have an economy

723
00:49:45,090 --> 00:49:47,550
work. Every free economy has good regulation.

724
00:49:47,550 --> 00:49:50,340
At the same time, regulation can become excessive.

725
00:49:50,340 --> 00:49:51,960
MR. LEHRER: Is it excessive now, do you think?

726
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:53,070
MR. ROMNEY: In some places, yes, in other
places, no.

727
00:49:53,070 --> 00:49:53,820
MR. LEHRER: Like where?

728
00:49:53,820 --> 00:49:58,080
MR. ROMNEY: It can become out of date. And
what's happened in — with some of the legislation

729
00:49:58,080 --> 00:50:03,340
that's been passed during the president's
term, you've seen regulation become excessive

730
00:50:03,340 --> 00:50:08,480
and it's hurt the — it's hurt the economy.
Let me give you an example. Dodd- Frank was

731
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:13,720
passed, and it includes within it a number
of provisions that I think have some unintended

732
00:50:13,720 --> 00:50:18,020
consequences that are harmful to the economy.
One is it designates a number of banks as

733
00:50:18,020 --> 00:50:21,950
too big to fail, and they're effectively guaranteed
by the federal government.

734
00:50:21,950 --> 00:50:26,200
This is the biggest kiss that's been given
to — to New York banks I've ever seen. This

735
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:31,320
is an enormous boon for them. There's been
— 122 community and small banks have closed

736
00:50:31,320 --> 00:50:33,620
since Dodd-Frank. So there's one example.

737
00:50:33,620 --> 00:50:35,450
Here's another. In Dodd-Frank, it says that
—

738
00:50:35,450 --> 00:50:36,550
MR. LEHRER: You want to repeal Dodd-Frank?

739
00:50:36,550 --> 00:50:39,620
MR. ROMNEY: Well, I would repeal it and replace
it. You — we're not going to get rid of

740
00:50:39,620 --> 00:50:43,950
all regulation. You have to have regulation.
And there's some parts of Dodd-Frank that

741
00:50:43,950 --> 00:50:49,210
make all the sense in the world. You need
transparency, you need to have leverage limits

742
00:50:49,210 --> 00:50:50,680
for institutes —

743
00:50:50,680 --> 00:50:51,180
MR. LEHRER: Well, here's a specific — let's
— excuse me —

744
00:50:51,180 --> 00:50:53,430
MR. ROMNEY: Let me mention the other one.
Let's talk the —

745
00:50:53,430 --> 00:50:56,230
MR. LEHRER: No, no, let's do — right now,
let's not. Let's let him respond.

746
00:50:56,230 --> 00:50:56,840
MR. ROMNEY: OK.

747
00:50:56,840 --> 00:51:00,680
MR. LEHRER: Let's let him respond to this
specific on Dodd-Frank and what the governor

748
00:51:00,680 --> 00:51:01,340
just said.

749
00:51:01,340 --> 00:51:08,110
PRESIDENT OBAMA: Well, I think this is a great
example. The reason we have been in such a

750
00:51:08,110 --> 00:51:17,260
enormous economic crisis was prompted by reckless
behavior across the board. Now, it wasn't

751
00:51:17,260 --> 00:51:22,680
just on Wall Street. You had — loan officers
were — they were giving loans and mortgages

752
00:51:22,680 --> 00:51:27,490
that really shouldn't have been given, because
they're — the folks didn't qualify. You

753
00:51:27,490 --> 00:51:31,790
had people who were borrowing money to buy
a house that they couldn't afford. You had

754
00:51:31,790 --> 00:51:37,260
credit agencies that were stamping these as
A-1 (ph) great investments when they weren't.

755
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:43,930
But you also had banks making money hand-over-fist,
churning out products that the bankers themselves

756
00:51:43,930 --> 00:51:50,350
didn't even understand in order to make big
profits, but knowing that it made the entire

757
00:51:50,350 --> 00:51:52,410
system vulnerable.

758
00:51:52,410 --> 00:51:59,390
So what did we do? We stepped in and had the
toughest reforms on Wall Street since the

759
00:51:59,390 --> 00:52:03,150
1930s. We said you've got — banks, you've
got to raise your capital requirements. You

760
00:52:03,150 --> 00:52:07,240
can't engage in some of this risky behavior
that is putting Main Street at risk. We're

761
00:52:07,240 --> 00:52:12,000
going to make sure that you've got to have
a living will, so — so we can know how you're

762
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:16,650
going to wind things down if you make a bad
bet so we don't have other taxpayer bailouts.

763
00:52:16,650 --> 00:52:21,030
In the meantime, by the way, we also made
sure that all the help that we provided those

764
00:52:21,030 --> 00:52:24,950
banks was paid back, every single dime, with
interest.

765
00:52:24,950 --> 00:52:31,430
Now, Governor Romney has said he wants to
repeal Dodd-Frank, and, you know, I appreciate,

766
00:52:31,430 --> 00:52:36,940
and it appears we've got some agreement that
a marketplace to work has to have some regulation,

767
00:52:36,940 --> 00:52:40,770
but in the past, Governor Romney has said
he just wants to repeal Dodd-Frank, roll it

768
00:52:40,770 --> 00:52:48,340
back. And so the question is does anybody
out there think that the big problem we had

769
00:52:48,340 --> 00:52:56,690
is that there was too much oversight and regulation
of Wall Street? Because if you do, then Governor

770
00:52:56,690 --> 00:53:01,680
Romney is your candidate. But that's not what
I believe.

771
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:03,320
MR. ROMNEY: (Inaudible) — sorry, Jim. That
— that's just not — that's just not the

772
00:53:03,320 --> 00:53:06,350
facts. Look, we have to have regulation of
Wall Street.

773
00:53:06,350 --> 00:53:06,970
PRESIDENT OBAMA: Yeah.

774
00:53:06,970 --> 00:53:10,870
MR. ROMNEY: That — that's why I'd have regulation.
But I wouldn't designate five banks as too

775
00:53:10,870 --> 00:53:16,630
big to fail and give them a blank check. That's
one of the unintended consequences of Dodd-Frank.

776
00:53:16,630 --> 00:53:19,800
It wasn't thought through properly. We need
to get rid of that provision, because it's

777
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:22,490
killing regional and small banks. They're
getting hurt.

778
00:53:22,490 --> 00:53:26,440
Let me mention another regulation of Dodd-Frank.
You say we were giving mortgages to people

779
00:53:26,440 --> 00:53:30,700
who weren't qualified. That's exactly right.
It's one of the reasons for the great financial

780
00:53:30,700 --> 00:53:35,070
calamity we had. And so Dodd-Frank correctly
says we need to —

781
00:53:35,070 --> 00:53:35,090
MR. LEHRER: All right.

782
00:53:35,090 --> 00:53:38,290
MR. ROMNEY: — have qualified mortgages,
and if you give a mortgage that's not qualified,

783
00:53:38,290 --> 00:53:43,420
there are big penalties. Except they didn't
ever go on to define what a qualified mortgage

784
00:53:43,420 --> 00:53:43,540
was.

785
00:53:43,540 --> 00:53:44,040
MR. LEHRER: All right.

786
00:53:44,040 --> 00:53:47,890
MR. ROMNEY: It's been two years. We don't
know what a qualified mortgage is yet. So

787
00:53:47,890 --> 00:53:53,850
banks are reluctant to make loans, mortgages.
Try and get a mortgage these days. It's hurt

788
00:53:53,850 --> 00:53:54,750
the housing market —

789
00:53:54,750 --> 00:53:55,150
MR. LEHRER: All right —

790
00:53:55,150 --> 00:53:59,970
MR. ROMNEY: — because Dodd-Frank didn't
anticipate putting in place the kinds of regulations

791
00:53:59,970 --> 00:54:04,560
you have to have. It's not that Dodd- Frank
always was wrong with too much regulation.

792
00:54:04,560 --> 00:54:06,790
Sometimes they didn't come out with a clear
regulation.

793
00:54:06,790 --> 00:54:06,990
MR. LEHRER: OK.

794
00:54:06,990 --> 00:54:11,260
MR. ROMNEY: I will make sure we don't hurt
the functioning of our — of our marketplace

795
00:54:11,260 --> 00:54:14,930
and our businesses, because I want to bring
back housing and get good jobs.

796
00:54:14,930 --> 00:54:20,080
MR. LEHRER: All right, I think we have another
clear difference between the two of you. Now

797
00:54:20,080 --> 00:54:25,070
let's move to health care, where I know there
is a clear difference — (laughter) — and

798
00:54:25,070 --> 00:54:28,860
that has to do with the Affordable Care Act,
"Obamacare."

799
00:54:28,860 --> 00:54:34,040
And it's a two-minute new segment, and it's
— that means two minutes each. And you go

800
00:54:34,040 --> 00:54:39,660
first, Governor Romney. You wanted repeal.
You want the Affordable Care Act repealed.

801
00:54:39,660 --> 00:54:39,870
Why?

802
00:54:39,870 --> 00:54:46,390
MR. ROMNEY: I sure do. Well, in part, it comes,
again, from my experience. I was in New Hampshire.

803
00:54:46,390 --> 00:54:50,610
A woman came to me, and she said, look, I
can't afford insurance for myself or my son.

804
00:54:50,610 --> 00:54:55,110
I met a couple in Appleton, Wisconsin, and
they said, we're thinking of dropping our

805
00:54:55,110 --> 00:54:58,910
insurance; we can't afford it. And the number
of small businesses I've gone to that are

806
00:54:58,910 --> 00:55:02,700
saying they're dropping insurance because
they can't afford it — the cost of health

807
00:55:02,700 --> 00:55:06,730
care is just prohibitive. And — and we've
got to deal with cost.

808
00:55:06,730 --> 00:55:11,640
And unfortunately, when — when you look
at "Obamacare," the Congressional Budget Office

809
00:55:11,640 --> 00:55:18,810
has said it will cost $2,500 a year more than
traditional insurance. So it's adding to cost.

810
00:55:18,810 --> 00:55:22,620
And as a matter of fact, when the president
ran for office, he said that by this year

811
00:55:22,620 --> 00:55:28,130
he would have brought down the cost of insurance
for each family by $2,500 a family. Instead,

812
00:55:28,130 --> 00:55:33,460
it's gone up by that amount. So it's expensive.
Expensive things hurt families. So that's

813
00:55:33,460 --> 00:55:34,940
one reason I don't want it.

814
00:55:34,940 --> 00:55:40,650
Second reason, it cuts $716 billion from Medicare
to pay for it. I want to put that money back

815
00:55:40,650 --> 00:55:42,690
in Medicare for our seniors.

816
00:55:42,690 --> 00:55:47,370
Number three, it puts in place an unelected
board that's going to tell people, ultimately,

817
00:55:47,370 --> 00:55:50,830
what kind of treatments they can have. I don't
like that idea.

818
00:55:50,830 --> 00:55:56,450
Fourth, there was a survey done of small businesses
across the country. It said, what's been the

819
00:55:56,450 --> 00:56:00,810
effect of "Obamacare" on your hiring plans?
And three-quarters of them said, it makes

820
00:56:00,810 --> 00:56:06,500
us less likely to hire people. I just don't
know how the president could have come into

821
00:56:06,500 --> 00:56:11,870
office, facing 23 million people out of work,
rising unemployment, an economic crisis at

822
00:56:11,870 --> 00:56:15,930
the — at the kitchen table and spent his
energy and passion for two years fighting

823
00:56:15,930 --> 00:56:19,950
for "Obamacare" instead of fighting for jobs
for the American people.

824
00:56:19,950 --> 00:56:25,780
It has killed jobs. And the best course for
health care is to do what we did in my state,

825
00:56:25,780 --> 00:56:31,110
craft a plan at the state level that fits
the needs of the state. And then let's focus

826
00:56:31,110 --> 00:56:36,340
on getting the costs down for people rather
than raising it with the $2,500 additional

827
00:56:36,340 --> 00:56:36,660
premium.

828
00:56:36,660 --> 00:56:39,670
MR. LEHRER: Mr. President, the argument against
repeal.

829
00:56:39,670 --> 00:56:44,370
PRESIDENT OBAMA: Well, four years ago when
I was running for office I was traveling around

830
00:56:44,370 --> 00:56:50,320
and having those same conversations that Governor
Romney talks about. And it wasn't just that

831
00:56:50,320 --> 00:56:55,090
small businesses were seeing costs skyrocket
and they couldn't get affordable coverage

832
00:56:55,090 --> 00:56:59,010
even if they wanted to provide it to their
employees; it wasn't just that this was the

833
00:56:59,010 --> 00:57:04,620
biggest driver of our federal deficit, our
overall health care costs. But it was families

834
00:57:04,620 --> 00:57:09,650
who were worried about going bankrupt if they
got sick — millions of families, all across

835
00:57:09,650 --> 00:57:10,210
the country.

836
00:57:10,210 --> 00:57:15,860
If they had a pre-existing condition they
might not be able to get coverage at all.

837
00:57:15,860 --> 00:57:23,100
If they did have coverage, insurance companies
might impose an arbitrary limit. And so as

838
00:57:23,100 --> 00:57:27,720
a consequence, they're paying their premiums,
somebody gets really sick, lo and behold they

839
00:57:27,720 --> 00:57:32,840
don't have enough money to pay the bills because
the insurance companies say that they've hit

840
00:57:32,840 --> 00:57:39,440
the limit. So we did work on this alongside
working on jobs, because this is part of making

841
00:57:39,440 --> 00:57:42,920
sure that middle-class families are secure
in this country.

842
00:57:42,920 --> 00:57:48,070
And let me tell you exactly what "Obamacare"
did. Number one, if you've got health insurance

843
00:57:48,070 --> 00:57:54,270
it doesn't mean a government take over. You
keep your own insurance. You keep your own

844
00:57:54,270 --> 00:57:59,190
doctor. But it does say insurance companies
can't jerk you around. They can't impose arbitrary

845
00:57:59,190 --> 00:58:05,180
lifetime limits. They have to let you keep
your kid on their insurance — your insurance

846
00:58:05,180 --> 00:58:11,670
plan till you're 26 years old. And it also
says that they're — you're going to have

847
00:58:11,670 --> 00:58:17,950
to get rebates if insurance companies are
spending more on administrative costs and

848
00:58:17,950 --> 00:58:21,110
profits than they are on actual care.

849
00:58:21,110 --> 00:58:26,060
Number two, if you don't have health insurance,
we're essentially setting up a group plan

850
00:58:26,060 --> 00:58:32,020
that allows you to benefit from group rates
that are typically 18 percent lower than if

851
00:58:32,020 --> 00:58:35,430
you're out there trying to get insurance on
the individual market.

852
00:58:35,430 --> 00:58:38,560
Now, the last point I'd make before —

853
00:58:38,560 --> 00:58:38,850
MR. LEHRER: Two minutes —

854
00:58:38,850 --> 00:58:39,060
PRESIDENT OBAMA: — before —

855
00:58:39,060 --> 00:58:39,810
MR. LEHRER: Two minutes is up, sir.

856
00:58:39,810 --> 00:58:42,710
PRESIDENT OBAMA: No, I — I think I've — I
had five seconds before you interrupted me

857
00:58:42,710 --> 00:58:50,730
— was — (laughter) — that the irony
is that we've seen this model work really

858
00:58:50,730 --> 00:59:00,220
well in Massachusetts, because Governor Romney
did a good thing, working with Democrats in

859
00:59:00,220 --> 00:59:07,970
the state to set up what is essentially the
identical model. And as a consequence, people

860
00:59:07,970 --> 00:59:14,850
are covered there. It hasn't destroyed jobs.
And as a consequence, we now have a system

861
00:59:14,850 --> 00:59:18,620
in which we have the opportunity to start
bringing down cost, as opposed to just —

862
00:59:18,620 --> 00:59:19,430
MR. LEHRER: Your five —

863
00:59:19,430 --> 00:59:21,230
PRESIDENT OBAMA: — leaving millions of people
out in the cold.

864
00:59:21,230 --> 00:59:23,760
MR. LEHRER: Your five seconds went away a
long time ago. (Laughter.)

865
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:24,340
PRESIDENT OBAMA: That —

866
00:59:24,340 --> 00:59:29,280
MR. LEHRER: All right, Governor. Governor,
tell the — tell the president directly why

867
00:59:29,280 --> 00:59:31,470
you think what he just said is wrong about
"Obamacare."

868
00:59:31,470 --> 00:59:33,220
MR. ROMNEY: Well, I did with my first statement.

869
00:59:33,220 --> 00:59:33,980
PRESIDENT OBAMA: You did.

870
00:59:33,980 --> 00:59:35,140
MR. ROMNEY: But I'll go on.

871
00:59:35,140 --> 00:59:35,900
PRESIDENT OBAMA: Please elaborate.

872
00:59:35,900 --> 00:59:36,670
MR. ROMNEY: I'll elaborate.

873
00:59:36,670 --> 00:59:37,060
Exactly right.

874
00:59:37,060 --> 00:59:42,180
First of all, I like the way we did it in
Massachusetts. I like the fact that in my

875
00:59:42,180 --> 00:59:47,590
state, we had Republicans and Democrats come
together and work together. What you did instead

876
00:59:47,590 --> 00:59:51,620
was to push through a plan without a single
Republican vote. As a matter of fact, when

877
00:59:51,620 --> 00:59:56,480
Massachusetts did something quite extraordinary,
elected a Republican senator to stop "Obamacare,"

878
00:59:56,480 --> 01:00:00,510
you pushed it through anyway. So entirely
on a partisan basis, instead of bringing America

879
01:00:00,510 --> 01:00:04,920
together and having a discussion on this important
topic, you pushed through something that you

880
01:00:04,920 --> 01:00:08,680
and Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid thought was
the best answer and drove it through.

881
01:00:08,680 --> 01:00:15,480
What we did, in a legislature 87 percent Democrat,
we worked together. Two hundred legislators

882
01:00:15,480 --> 01:00:19,130
in my legislature — only two voted against
the plan by the time we were finished.

883
01:00:19,130 --> 01:00:20,670
What were some differences?

884
01:00:20,670 --> 01:00:24,810
We didn't raise taxes. You've raised them
by a trillion dollars under "Obamacare." We

885
01:00:24,810 --> 01:00:29,610
didn't cut Medicare. Of course, we don't have
Medicare, but we didn't cut Medicare by $716

886
01:00:29,610 --> 01:00:33,630
billion. We didn't put in place a board that
can tell people ultimately what treatments

887
01:00:33,630 --> 01:00:35,110
they're going to receive.

888
01:00:35,110 --> 01:00:40,450
We didn't — we didn't also do something
that I think a number of people across this

889
01:00:40,450 --> 01:00:43,440
country recognize, which is put — put people
in a position where they're going to lose

890
01:00:43,440 --> 01:00:49,090
the insurance they had and they wanted. Right
now, the CBO says up to 20 million people

891
01:00:49,090 --> 01:00:54,190
will lose their insurance as "Obamacare" goes
into effect next year. And likewise, a study

892
01:00:54,190 --> 01:00:59,180
by McKinsey & Company of American businesses
said 30 percent of them are anticipating dropping

893
01:00:59,180 --> 01:01:04,830
people from coverage. So for those reasons,
for the tax, for Medicare, for this board

894
01:01:04,830 --> 01:01:09,790
and for people losing their insurance, this
is why the American people don't want — don't

895
01:01:09,790 --> 01:01:13,570
want "Obamacare." It's why Republicans said,
do not do this.

896
01:01:13,570 --> 01:01:16,960
And the Republicans had a — had a plan.
They put a plan out. They put out a plan,

897
01:01:16,960 --> 01:01:22,690
a bipartisan plan. It was swept aside. I think
something this big, this important has to

898
01:01:22,690 --> 01:01:26,750
be done in a bipartisan basis. And we have
to have a president who can reach across the

899
01:01:26,750 --> 01:01:31,070
aisle and fashion important legislation with
the input from both parties.

900
01:01:31,070 --> 01:01:35,290
PRESIDENT OBAMA: Governor Romney said this
has to be done on a bipartisan basis. This

901
01:01:35,290 --> 01:01:39,020
was a bipartisan idea. In fact, it was a Republican
idea.

902
01:01:39,020 --> 01:01:44,130
And Governor Romney, at the beginning of this
debate, wrote and said, what we did in Massachusetts

903
01:01:44,130 --> 01:01:50,200
could be a model for the nation. And I agree
that the Democratic legislators in Massachusetts

904
01:01:50,200 --> 01:01:55,990
might have given some advice to Republicans
in Congress about how to cooperate, but the

905
01:01:55,990 --> 01:02:01,740
fact of the matter is, we used the same advisers,
and they say it's the same plan.

906
01:02:01,740 --> 01:02:07,250
It — when Governor Romney talks about this
board, for example — unelected board that

907
01:02:07,250 --> 01:02:13,210
we've created — what this is, is a group
of health care experts, doctors, et cetera,

908
01:02:13,210 --> 01:02:21,840
to figure out how can we reduce the cost of
care in the system overall, because the — there

909
01:02:21,840 --> 01:02:25,660
are two ways of dealing with our health care
crisis.

910
01:02:25,660 --> 01:02:30,660
One is to simply leave a whole bunch of people
uninsured and let them fend for themselves,

911
01:02:30,660 --> 01:02:35,400
to let businesses figure out how long they
can continue to pay premiums until finally

912
01:02:35,400 --> 01:02:39,260
they just give up and their workers are no
longer getting insured, and that's been the

913
01:02:39,260 --> 01:02:44,630
trend line. Or, alternatively, we can figure
out how do we make the cost of care more effective.

914
01:02:44,630 --> 01:02:46,700
And there are ways of doing it.

915
01:02:46,700 --> 01:02:52,610
So at — at Cleveland Clinic, one of the
best health care systems in the world, they

916
01:02:52,610 --> 01:02:59,090
actually provide great care cheaper than average.
And the reason they do is because they do

917
01:02:59,090 --> 01:03:03,920
some smart things. They — they say, if a
patient's coming in, let's get all the doctors

918
01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:10,900
together at once, do one test instead of having
the patient run around with 10 tests. Let's

919
01:03:10,900 --> 01:03:14,870
make sure that we're providing preventive
care so we're catching the onset of something

920
01:03:14,870 --> 01:03:22,740
like diabetes. Let's — let's pay providers
on the basis of performance as opposed to

921
01:03:22,740 --> 01:03:30,260
on the basis of how many procedures they've
— they've engaged in. Now, so what this

922
01:03:30,260 --> 01:03:35,920
board does is basically identifies best practices
and says, let's use the purchasing power of

923
01:03:35,920 --> 01:03:41,630
Medicare and Medicaid to help to institutionalize
all these good things that we do.

924
01:03:41,630 --> 01:03:48,130
And the fact of the matter is that when "Obamacare"
is fully implemented, we're going to be in

925
01:03:48,130 --> 01:03:55,470
a position to show that costs are going down.
And over the last two years, health care premiums

926
01:03:55,470 --> 01:04:00,740
have gone up, it's true, but they've gone
up slower than any time in the last 50 years.

927
01:04:00,740 --> 01:04:05,230
So we're already beginning to see progress.
In the meantime, folks out there with insurance,

928
01:04:05,230 --> 01:04:07,240
you're already getting a rebate.

929
01:04:07,240 --> 01:04:13,370
Let me make one last point. Governor Romney
says we should replace it. I'm just going

930
01:04:13,370 --> 01:04:18,540
to repeal it, but we can replace it with something.
But the problem is he hasn't described what

931
01:04:18,540 --> 01:04:22,260
exactly we'd replace it with other than saying
we're going to leave it to the states.

932
01:04:22,260 --> 01:04:28,180
But the fact of the matter is that some of
the prescriptions that he's offered, like

933
01:04:28,180 --> 01:04:32,460
letting you buy insurance across state lines,
there's no indication that that somehow is

934
01:04:32,460 --> 01:04:36,930
going to help somebody who's got a pre-existing
condition be able to finally buy insurance.

935
01:04:36,930 --> 01:04:41,160
In fact, it's estimated that by repealing
"Obamacare," you're looking at 50 million

936
01:04:41,160 --> 01:04:45,440
people losing health insurance at a time when
it's vitally important.

937
01:04:45,440 --> 01:04:49,870
MR. LEHRER: Let's let the governor explain
what you would do if "Obamacare" is repealed.

938
01:04:49,870 --> 01:04:51,530
How would you replace it? What do you have
in mind?

939
01:04:51,530 --> 01:04:55,290
MR. ROMNEY: Let — well, actually — actually
it's — it's — it's a lengthy description,

940
01:04:55,290 --> 01:05:00,000
but number one, pre-existing conditions are
covered under my plan. Number two, young people

941
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:04,070
are able to stay on their family plan. That's
already offered in the private marketplace;

942
01:05:04,070 --> 01:05:07,640
you don't have — have the government mandate
that for that to occur.

943
01:05:07,640 --> 01:05:12,930
But let's come back to something the president
— I agree on, which is the — the key task

944
01:05:12,930 --> 01:05:17,740
we have in health care is to get the costs
down so it's more affordable for families,

945
01:05:17,740 --> 01:05:23,240
and — and then he has as a model for doing
that a board of people at the government,

946
01:05:23,240 --> 01:05:27,150
an unelected board, appointed board, who are
going to decide what kind of treatment you

947
01:05:27,150 --> 01:05:27,700
ought to have.

948
01:05:27,700 --> 01:05:28,200
PRESIDENT OBAMA: No, it isn't.

949
01:05:28,200 --> 01:05:34,820
MR. ROMNEY: In my opinion, the government
is not effective in — in bringing down the

950
01:05:34,820 --> 01:05:39,340
cost of almost anything. As a matter of fact,
free people and free enterprises trying to

951
01:05:39,340 --> 01:05:43,620
find ways to do things better are able to
be more effective in bringing down the costs

952
01:05:43,620 --> 01:05:48,960
than the government will ever be. Your example
of the Cleveland clinic is my case in point,

953
01:05:48,960 --> 01:05:53,920
along with several others I could describe.
This is the private market. These are small

954
01:05:53,920 --> 01:05:58,160
— these are enterprises competing with each
other, learning how to do better and better

955
01:05:58,160 --> 01:05:58,520
jobs.

956
01:05:58,520 --> 01:06:02,540
I used to consult to businesses — excuse
me, to hospitals and to health care providers.

957
01:06:02,540 --> 01:06:09,280
I was astonished at the creativity and innovation
that exists in the American people. In order

958
01:06:09,280 --> 01:06:12,810
to bring the cost of health care down, we
don't need to have a — an — a board of

959
01:06:12,810 --> 01:06:19,500
15 people telling us what kinds of treatments
we should have. We instead need to put insurance

960
01:06:19,500 --> 01:06:25,300
plans, providers, hospitals, doctors on targets
such that they have an incentive, as you say,

961
01:06:25,300 --> 01:06:29,870
performance pay, for doing an excellent job,
for keeping costs down, and that's happening.

962
01:06:29,870 --> 01:06:31,770
Intermountain Health Care does it superbly
well.

963
01:06:31,770 --> 01:06:32,070
PRESIDENT OBAMA: They do.

964
01:06:32,070 --> 01:06:36,410
MR. ROMNEY: Mayo Clinic is doing it superbly
well, Cleveland Clinic, others. But the right

965
01:06:36,410 --> 01:06:42,800
answer is not to have the federal government
take over health care and start mandating

966
01:06:42,800 --> 01:06:47,820
to the providers across America, telling a
patient and a doctor what kind of treatment

967
01:06:47,820 --> 01:06:53,080
they can have. That's the wrong way to go.
The private market and individual responsibility

968
01:06:53,080 --> 01:06:54,450
always work best.

969
01:06:54,450 --> 01:06:58,760
PRESIDENT OBAMA: Let me just point out, first
of all, this board that we're talking about

970
01:06:58,760 --> 01:07:04,690
can't make decisions about what treatments
are given. That's explicitly prohibited in

971
01:07:04,690 --> 01:07:06,040
the law.

972
01:07:06,040 --> 01:07:11,980
But let's go back to what Governor Romney
indicated, that under his plan he would be

973
01:07:11,980 --> 01:07:18,070
able to cover people with pre-existing conditions.
Well, actually, Governor, that isn't what

974
01:07:18,070 --> 01:07:24,170
your plan does. What your plan does is to
duplicate what's already the law, which says

975
01:07:24,170 --> 01:07:31,890
if you are out of health insurance for three
months then you can end up getting continuous

976
01:07:31,890 --> 01:07:39,760
coverage and an insurance company can't deny
you if you've — if it's been under 90 days.

977
01:07:39,760 --> 01:07:44,560
But that's already the law. And that doesn't
help the millions of people out there with

978
01:07:44,560 --> 01:07:49,190
pre-existing conditions. There's a reason
why Governor Romney set up the plan that he

979
01:07:49,190 --> 01:07:53,500
did in Massachusetts. It wasn't a government
takeover of health care. It was the largest

980
01:07:53,500 --> 01:08:00,420
expansion of private insurance. But what it
does say is that insurers, you've got to take

981
01:08:00,420 --> 01:08:04,980
everybody. Now, that also means that you've
got more customers.

982
01:08:04,980 --> 01:08:11,900
But when Governor Romney says that he'll replace
it with something but can't detail how it

983
01:08:11,900 --> 01:08:17,909
will be in fact replaced, and the reason he
set up the system he did in Massachusetts

984
01:08:17,909 --> 01:08:22,529
is because there isn't a better way of dealing
with the pre-existing conditions problem,

985
01:08:22,529 --> 01:08:25,949
it — it just reminds me of — you know,
he says that he's going to close deductions

986
01:08:25,949 --> 01:08:28,400
and loopholes for his tax plan.

987
01:08:28,400 --> 01:08:32,150
That's how it's going to be paid for. But
we don't know the details. He says that he's

988
01:08:32,150 --> 01:08:40,659
going to replace Dodd-Frank, Wall Street reform.
But we don't know exactly which ones. He won't

989
01:08:40,659 --> 01:08:44,569
tell us. He now says he's going to replace
"Obamacare" and assure that all the good things

990
01:08:44,569 --> 01:08:49,739
that are in it are going to be in there and
you don't have to worry.

991
01:08:49,739 --> 01:08:53,639
And at some point, I think the American people
have to ask themselves, is the reason that

992
01:08:53,639 --> 01:09:01,259
Governor Romney is keeping all these plans
to replace secret because they're too good?

993
01:09:01,259 --> 01:09:05,880
Is — is it because that somehow middle-class
families are going to benefit too much from

994
01:09:05,880 --> 01:09:12,889
them? No, the — the reason is because when
we reform Wall Street, when we tackle the

995
01:09:12,889 --> 01:09:18,190
problem of pre-existing conditions, then,
you know, these are tough problems, and we've

996
01:09:18,190 --> 01:09:22,559
got to make choices. And the choices we've
made have been ones that ultimately are benefiting

997
01:09:22,559 --> 01:09:24,019
middle-class families all across the country.

998
01:09:24,019 --> 01:09:25,279
MR. LEHRER: All right, we're going to move
to a —

999
01:09:25,279 --> 01:09:26,859
MR. ROMNEY: No, I — I have to respond to
that —

1000
01:09:26,859 --> 01:09:26,980
MR. LEHRER: No, but —

1001
01:09:26,980 --> 01:09:32,210
MR. ROMNEY: — which is — which is my experience
as a governor is if I come in and — and

1002
01:09:32,210 --> 01:09:37,389
lay down a piece of legislation and say it's
my way or the highway, I don't get a lot done.

1003
01:09:37,389 --> 01:09:40,849
What I do is the same way that Tip O'Neill
and Ronald Reagan worked together some years

1004
01:09:40,849 --> 01:09:46,059
ago. When Ronald Reagan ran for office, he
laid out the principles that he was going

1005
01:09:46,059 --> 01:09:50,719
to foster. He said he was going to lower tax
rates. He said he was going to broaden the

1006
01:09:50,719 --> 01:09:54,889
base. You've said the same thing: You're going
to simplify the tax code, broaden the base.

1007
01:09:54,889 --> 01:09:55,699
Those are my principles.

1008
01:09:55,699 --> 01:09:59,630
I want to bring down the tax burden on middle-income
families. And I'm going to work together with

1009
01:09:59,630 --> 01:10:04,630
Congress to say, OK, what are the various
ways we could bring down deductions, for instance?

1010
01:10:04,630 --> 01:10:08,869
One way, for instance, would be to have a
single number. Make up a number — 25,000

1011
01:10:08,869 --> 01:10:13,960
(dollars), $50,000. Anybody can have deductions
up to that amount. And then that number disappears

1012
01:10:13,960 --> 01:10:18,110
for high-income people. That's one way one
could do it. One could follow Bowles-Simpson

1013
01:10:18,110 --> 01:10:22,389
as a model and take deduction by deduction
and make differences that way.

1014
01:10:22,389 --> 01:10:27,539
There are alternatives to accomplish the objective
I have, which is to bring down rates, broaden

1015
01:10:27,539 --> 01:10:32,019
the base, simplify the code and create incentives
for growth.

1016
01:10:32,019 --> 01:10:37,070
And with regards to health care, you had remarkable
details with regards to my pre-existing condition

1017
01:10:37,070 --> 01:10:41,499
plan. You obviously studied up on — on my
plan. In fact, I do have a plan that deals

1018
01:10:41,499 --> 01:10:45,489
with people with pre-existing conditions.
That's part of my health care plan. And what

1019
01:10:45,489 --> 01:10:50,610
we did in Massachusetts is a model for the
nation, state by state. And I said that at

1020
01:10:50,610 --> 01:10:55,940
that time. The federal government taking over
health care for the entire nation and whisking

1021
01:10:55,940 --> 01:11:00,630
aside the 10th Amendment, which gives states
the rights for these kinds of things, is not

1022
01:11:00,630 --> 01:11:03,690
the course for America to have a stronger,
more vibrant economy.

1023
01:11:03,690 --> 01:11:13,070
MR. LEHRER: That is a terrific segue to our
next segment, and is the role of government.

1024
01:11:13,070 --> 01:11:18,780
And let's see, role of government and it is
— you are first on this, Mr. President.

1025
01:11:18,780 --> 01:11:24,489
The question is this. Do you believe — both
of you — but you have the first two minutes

1026
01:11:24,489 --> 01:11:28,219
on this, Mr. President — do you believe
there's a fundamental difference between the

1027
01:11:28,219 --> 01:11:33,159
two of you as to how you view the mission
of the federal government?

1028
01:11:33,159 --> 01:11:36,869
PRESIDENT OBAMA: Well, I definitely think
there are differences.

1029
01:11:36,869 --> 01:11:38,519
MR. LEHRER: And — yeah.

1030
01:11:38,519 --> 01:11:41,809
PRESIDENT OBAMA: The first role of the federal
government is to keep the American people

1031
01:11:41,809 --> 01:11:48,369
safe. That's its most basic function. And
as commander in chief, that is something that

1032
01:11:48,369 --> 01:11:55,280
I've worked on and thought about every single
day that I've been in the Oval Office.

1033
01:11:55,280 --> 01:12:00,900
But I also believe that government has the
capacity — the federal government has the

1034
01:12:00,900 --> 01:12:07,260
capacity to help open up opportunity and create
ladders of opportunity and to create frameworks

1035
01:12:07,260 --> 01:12:12,130
where the American people can succeed. Look,
the genius of America is the free enterprise

1036
01:12:12,130 --> 01:12:18,659
system, and freedom, and the fact that people
can go out there and start a business, work

1037
01:12:18,659 --> 01:12:21,710
on an idea, make their own decisions.

1038
01:12:21,710 --> 01:12:27,530
But as Abraham Lincoln understood, there are
also some things we do better together.

1039
01:12:27,530 --> 01:12:33,469
So in the middle of the Civil War, Abraham
Lincoln said, let's help to finance the Transcontinental

1040
01:12:33,469 --> 01:12:42,999
Railroad. Let's start the National Academy
of Sciences. Let's start land grant colleges,

1041
01:12:42,999 --> 01:12:48,289
because we want to give these gateways of
opportunity for all Americans, because if

1042
01:12:48,289 --> 01:12:52,460
all Americans are getting opportunity, we're
all going to be better off. That doesn't restrict

1043
01:12:52,460 --> 01:12:55,639
people's freedom; that enhances it.

1044
01:12:55,639 --> 01:13:01,469
And so what I've tried to do as president
is to apply those same principles. And when

1045
01:13:01,469 --> 01:13:06,989
it comes to education, what I've said is we've
got to reform schools that are not working.

1046
01:13:06,989 --> 01:13:10,929
We use something called Race to the Top. Wasn't
a top-down approach, Governor. What we've

1047
01:13:10,929 --> 01:13:17,230
said is to states, we'll give you more money
if you initiate reforms. And as a consequence,

1048
01:13:17,230 --> 01:13:21,639
you had 46 states around the country who have
made a real difference.

1049
01:13:21,639 --> 01:13:26,550
But what I've also said is let's hire another
hundred thousand math and science teachers

1050
01:13:26,550 --> 01:13:31,349
to make sure we maintain our technological
lead and our people are skilled and able to

1051
01:13:31,349 --> 01:13:38,219
succeed. And hard-pressed states right now
can't all do that. In fact, we've seen layoffs

1052
01:13:38,219 --> 01:13:43,349
of hundreds of thousands of teachers over
the last several years, and Governor Romney

1053
01:13:43,349 --> 01:13:48,239
doesn't think we need more teachers. I do,
because I think that that is the kind of investment

1054
01:13:48,239 --> 01:13:53,360
where the federal government can help. It
can't do it all, but it can make a difference,

1055
01:13:53,360 --> 01:13:57,619
and as a consequence, we'll have a better-trained
workforce, and that will create jobs, because

1056
01:13:57,619 --> 01:14:00,469
companies want to locate in places where we've
got a skilled workforce.

1057
01:14:00,469 --> 01:14:03,079
MR. LEHRER: Two minutes, Governor, on the
role of government, your view.

1058
01:14:03,079 --> 01:14:07,239
MR. ROMNEY: Well, first, I love great schools.
Massachusetts, our schools are ranked number

1059
01:14:07,239 --> 01:14:12,900
one of all 50 states. And the key to great
schools: great teachers. So I reject the idea

1060
01:14:12,900 --> 01:14:16,400
that I don't believe in great teachers or
more teachers. Every school district, every

1061
01:14:16,400 --> 01:14:18,429
state should make that decision on their own.

1062
01:14:18,429 --> 01:14:24,170
The role of government — look behind us:
the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence.

1063
01:14:24,170 --> 01:14:32,159
The role of government is to promote and protect
the principles of those documents. First,

1064
01:14:32,159 --> 01:14:36,679
life and liberty. We have a responsibility
to protect the lives and liberties of our

1065
01:14:36,679 --> 01:14:41,119
people, and that means the military, second
to none. I do not believe in cutting our military.

1066
01:14:41,119 --> 01:14:44,710
I believe in maintaining the strength of America's
military.

1067
01:14:44,710 --> 01:14:50,719
Second, in that line that says, we are endowed
by our Creator with our rights — I believe

1068
01:14:50,719 --> 01:14:56,420
we must maintain our commitment to religious
tolerance and freedom in this country. That

1069
01:14:56,420 --> 01:15:01,050
statement also says that we are endowed by
our Creator with the right to pursue happiness

1070
01:15:01,050 --> 01:15:05,940
as we choose. I interpret that as, one, making
sure that those people who are less fortunate

1071
01:15:05,940 --> 01:15:08,999
and can't care for themselves are cared by
— by one another.

1072
01:15:08,999 --> 01:15:13,210
We're a nation that believes we're all children
of the same God. And we care for those that

1073
01:15:13,210 --> 01:15:17,360
have difficulties — those that are elderly
and have problems and challenges, those that

1074
01:15:17,360 --> 01:15:21,920
disabled, we care for them. And we look for
discovery and innovation, all these thing

1075
01:15:21,920 --> 01:15:28,050
desired out of the American heart to provide
the pursuit of happiness for our citizens.

1076
01:15:28,050 --> 01:15:33,809
But we also believe in maintaining for individuals
the right to pursue their dreams, and not

1077
01:15:33,809 --> 01:15:38,539
to have the government substitute itself for
the rights of free individuals. And what we're

1078
01:15:38,539 --> 01:15:44,510
seeing right now is, in my view, a — a trickle-down
government approach which has government thinking

1079
01:15:44,510 --> 01:15:49,150
it can do a better job than free people pursuing
their dreams. And it's not working.

1080
01:15:49,150 --> 01:15:52,909
And the proof of that is 23 million people
out of work. The proof of that is one out

1081
01:15:52,909 --> 01:15:57,999
of six people in poverty. The proof of that
is we've gone from 32 million on food stamps

1082
01:15:57,999 --> 01:16:03,170
to 47 million on food stamps. The proof of
that is that 50 percent of college graduates

1083
01:16:03,170 --> 01:16:04,809
this year can't find work.

1084
01:16:04,809 --> 01:16:05,070
PRESIDENT OBAMA: (Inaudible) —

1085
01:16:05,070 --> 01:16:09,610
MR. ROMNEY: We know that the path we're taking
is not working. It's time for a new path.

1086
01:16:09,610 --> 01:16:12,710
MR. LEHRER: All right, let's go through some
specifics in terms of what — how each of

1087
01:16:12,710 --> 01:16:19,420
you views the role of government. How do — education.
Does the federal government have a responsibility

1088
01:16:19,420 --> 01:16:22,289
to improve the quality of public education
in America?

1089
01:16:22,289 --> 01:16:26,030
MR. ROMNEY: Well, the primary responsibility
for education is — is of course at the state

1090
01:16:26,030 --> 01:16:29,900
and local level. But the federal government
also can play a very important role. And I

1091
01:16:29,900 --> 01:16:33,980
— and I agree with Secretary Arne Duncan.
He's — there's some ideas he's put forward

1092
01:16:33,980 --> 01:16:37,409
on Race to the Top — not all of them but
some of them I agree with, and congratulate

1093
01:16:37,409 --> 01:16:41,639
him for pursuing that. The federal government
can get local and — and state schools to

1094
01:16:41,639 --> 01:16:42,699
do a better job.

1095
01:16:42,699 --> 01:16:47,059
My own view, by the way, is I've added to
that. I happen to believe — I want the kids

1096
01:16:47,059 --> 01:16:51,789
that are getting federal dollars from IDEA
or — or Title I — these are disabled kids

1097
01:16:51,789 --> 01:16:56,999
or — or poor kids or — or lower-income
kids, rather. I want them to be able to go

1098
01:16:56,999 --> 01:17:01,929
to the school of their choice. So all federal
funds, instead of going to the — to the

1099
01:17:01,929 --> 01:17:05,599
state or to the school district, I'd have
go — if you will, follow the child and let

1100
01:17:05,599 --> 01:17:08,670
the parent and the child decide where to send
their — their — their student.

1101
01:17:08,670 --> 01:17:13,670
MR. LEHRER: How do you see the federal government's
responsibility to — as I say, to improve

1102
01:17:13,670 --> 01:17:15,559
the quality of public education in this country?

1103
01:17:15,559 --> 01:17:18,749
PRESIDENT OBAMA: Well, as I've indicated,
I think that it has a significant role to

1104
01:17:18,749 --> 01:17:23,480
play. Through our Race to the Top program,
we've worked with Republican and Democratic

1105
01:17:23,480 --> 01:17:27,400
governors to initiate major reforms, and they're
having an impact right now.

1106
01:17:27,400 --> 01:17:31,820
MR. LEHRER: Do you think you have a difference
with your views and those of Governor Romney

1107
01:17:31,820 --> 01:17:33,210
on — about education and the federal government?

1108
01:17:33,210 --> 01:17:39,219
PRESIDENT OBAMA: You know, this is where budgets
matter because budgets reflect choices. So

1109
01:17:39,219 --> 01:17:48,110
when Governor Romney indicates that he wants
to cut taxes and potentially benefit folks

1110
01:17:48,110 --> 01:17:56,420
like me and him, and to pay for it, we're
having to initiate significant cuts in federal

1111
01:17:56,420 --> 01:17:59,099
support for education, that makes a difference.

1112
01:17:59,099 --> 01:18:04,780
You know, his running mate, Congressman Ryan,
put forward a budget that reflects many of

1113
01:18:04,780 --> 01:18:10,340
the principles that Governor Romney's talked
about. And it wasn't very detailed. This seems

1114
01:18:10,340 --> 01:18:15,690
to be a trend. But — but what it did do
is to — if you extrapolated how much money

1115
01:18:15,690 --> 01:18:21,039
we're talking about, you'd look at cutting
the education budget by up to 20 percent.

1116
01:18:21,039 --> 01:18:27,869
When it comes to community colleges, we are
seeing great work done out there all over

1117
01:18:27,869 --> 01:18:31,929
the country because we have the opportunity
to train people for jobs that exist right

1118
01:18:31,929 --> 01:18:35,489
now. And one of the things I suspect Governor
Romney and I probably agree on is getting

1119
01:18:35,489 --> 01:18:39,050
businesses to work with community colleges
so that they're setting up their training

1120
01:18:39,050 --> 01:18:39,619
programs —

1121
01:18:39,619 --> 01:18:40,869
MR. LEHRER: Do you agree, Governor?

1122
01:18:40,869 --> 01:18:42,599
PRESIDENT OBAMA: Let — let — let me just
finish the point.

1123
01:18:42,599 --> 01:18:43,570
MR. ROMNEY: Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

1124
01:18:43,570 --> 01:18:45,340
PRESIDENT OBAMA: I suspect it'll be a small
agreement.

1125
01:18:45,340 --> 01:18:47,579
MR. ROMNEY: It's going over well in my state,
by the way, yeah.

1126
01:18:47,579 --> 01:18:53,159
PRESIDENT OBAMA: The — where their partnering
so that — they're designing training programs,

1127
01:18:53,159 --> 01:18:56,360
and people who are going through them know
that there's a job waiting for them if they

1128
01:18:56,360 --> 01:19:00,389
complete them. That makes a big difference.
But that requires some federal support.

1129
01:19:00,389 --> 01:19:07,329
Let me just say one final example. When it
comes to making college affordable — whether

1130
01:19:07,329 --> 01:19:11,530
it's two-year or four-year — one of the
things that I did as president was we were

1131
01:19:11,530 --> 01:19:17,989
sending $60 billion to banks and lenders as
middle men for the student loan program, even

1132
01:19:17,989 --> 01:19:22,090
though the loans were guaranteed. So there
was no risk for the banks or the lenders but

1133
01:19:22,090 --> 01:19:23,809
they were taking billions out of the system.

1134
01:19:23,809 --> 01:19:28,789
And we said, why not cut out the middle man?
And as a consequence, what we've been able

1135
01:19:28,789 --> 01:19:36,409
to do is to provide millions more students
assistance, lower or keep low interest rates

1136
01:19:36,409 --> 01:19:42,929
on student loans. And this is an example of
where our priorities make a difference. Governor

1137
01:19:42,929 --> 01:19:50,860
Romney, I genuinely believe, cares about education.
But when he tells a student that, you know,

1138
01:19:50,860 --> 01:19:55,760
you should borrow money from your parents
to go to college, you know, that indicates

1139
01:19:55,760 --> 01:20:01,489
the degree to which, you know, there may not
be as much of a focus on the fact that folks

1140
01:20:01,489 --> 01:20:07,099
like myself, folks like Michelle, kids probably
who attend University of Denver just don't

1141
01:20:07,099 --> 01:20:07,989
have that option.

1142
01:20:07,989 --> 01:20:12,699
And for us to be able to make sure that they've
got that opportunity and they can walk through

1143
01:20:12,699 --> 01:20:16,940
that door, that is vitally important — not
just to those kids. It's how we're going to

1144
01:20:16,940 --> 01:20:18,559
grow this economy over the long term.

1145
01:20:18,559 --> 01:20:20,150
MR. LEHRER: We're running out of time.

1146
01:20:20,150 --> 01:20:20,150
MR. ROMNEY: Jim, Jim —

1147
01:20:20,150 --> 01:20:23,019
MR. LEHRER: I'm certainly going give you a
chance to respond to that. Yes, sir, Governor.

1148
01:20:23,019 --> 01:20:26,110
MR. ROMNEY: Mr. — Mr. President, you're
entitled, as the president, to your own airplane

1149
01:20:26,110 --> 01:20:29,190
and to your own house, but not to your own
facts — (laughter) — all right? I'm — I'm

1150
01:20:29,190 --> 01:20:34,400
not going to cut education funding. I don't
have any plan to cut education funding and

1151
01:20:34,400 --> 01:20:37,920
grants that go to people going to college.
I'm planning on continuing to grow, so I'm

1152
01:20:37,920 --> 01:20:39,469
not planning on making changes there.

1153
01:20:39,469 --> 01:20:43,889
But you make a very good point, which is that
the — the place you put your money makes

1154
01:20:43,889 --> 01:20:50,249
a pretty clear indication of where your heart
is. You put $90 billion into — into green

1155
01:20:50,249 --> 01:20:55,199
jobs. And — and I — look, I'm all in favor
of green energy. Ninety billion (dollars)

1156
01:20:55,199 --> 01:20:59,239
— that — that would have — that would
have hired 2 million teachers. Ninety billion

1157
01:20:59,239 --> 01:21:03,389
dollars. And these businesses — many of
them have gone out of business. I think about

1158
01:21:03,389 --> 01:21:06,650
half of them, of the ones have been invested
in, they've gone out of business. A number

1159
01:21:06,650 --> 01:21:10,550
of them happened to be owned by — by people
who were contributors to your campaigns.

1160
01:21:10,550 --> 01:21:15,440
Look, the right course for — for America's
government — we were talking about the role

1161
01:21:15,440 --> 01:21:20,210
of government — is not to become the economic
player picking winners and losers, telling

1162
01:21:20,210 --> 01:21:25,679
people what kind of health treatment they
can receive, taking over the health care system

1163
01:21:25,679 --> 01:21:29,550
that — that has existed in this country
for — for a long, long time and has produced

1164
01:21:29,550 --> 01:21:33,119
the best health records in the world. The
right answer for government is to say, how

1165
01:21:33,119 --> 01:21:36,949
do we make the private sector become more
efficient and more effective?

1166
01:21:36,949 --> 01:21:41,699
How do we get schools to be more competitive?
Let's grade them. I propose we grade our schools

1167
01:21:41,699 --> 01:21:45,650
so parents know which schools are succeeding
and failing, so they can take their child

1168
01:21:45,650 --> 01:21:49,769
to a — to a school that's being more successful.
I don't — I don't want to cut our commitment

1169
01:21:49,769 --> 01:21:53,429
to education; I wanted to make it more effective
and efficient.

1170
01:21:53,429 --> 01:21:58,670
And by the way, I've had that experience.
I don't just talk about it. I've been there.

1171
01:21:58,670 --> 01:22:02,889
Massachusetts schools are ranked number one
in the nation. This is not because I didn't

1172
01:22:02,889 --> 01:22:07,489
have commitment to education. It's because
I care about education for all of our kids.

1173
01:22:07,489 --> 01:22:07,820
MR. LEHRER: All right, gentlemen, look —

1174
01:22:07,820 --> 01:22:08,449
PRESIDENT OBAMA: Jim, I — (inaudible) —

1175
01:22:08,449 --> 01:22:12,020
MR. LEHRER: Excuse me, one sec — excuse,
me sir. (Laughter.) We've got — we've got

1176
01:22:12,020 --> 01:22:16,829
— barely have three minutes left. I'm not
going to grade the two of you and say you've

1177
01:22:16,829 --> 01:22:20,340
— your answers have been too long or I've
done a poor job —

1178
01:22:20,340 --> 01:22:21,400
PRESIDENT OBAMA: You've done a great job,
Jim.

1179
01:22:21,400 --> 01:22:25,789
MR. LEHRER: Oh, well, no. But the fact is,
government — the role of government and

1180
01:22:25,789 --> 01:22:31,989
governing, we've lost a (pod ?), in other
words, so we only have three minutes left

1181
01:22:31,989 --> 01:22:38,969
in the — in the debate before we go to your
closing statements. And so I want to ask finally

1182
01:22:38,969 --> 01:22:43,650
here — and remember, we've got three minutes
total time here.

1183
01:22:43,650 --> 01:22:48,860
And the question is this: Many of the legislative
functions of the federal government right

1184
01:22:48,860 --> 01:22:56,449
now are in a state of paralysis as a result
of partisan gridlock. If elected in your case,

1185
01:22:56,449 --> 01:22:59,769
if re-elected in your case, what would you
do about that?

1186
01:22:59,769 --> 01:23:00,030
Governor?

1187
01:23:00,030 --> 01:23:04,150
MR. ROMNEY: Jim, I had the great experience
— it didn't seem like it at the time — of

1188
01:23:04,150 --> 01:23:09,349
being elected in a state where my legislature
was 87 percent Democrat, and that meant I

1189
01:23:09,349 --> 01:23:13,219
figured out from day one I had to get along
and I had to work across the aisle to get

1190
01:23:13,219 --> 01:23:17,889
anything done. We drove our schools to be
number one in the nation. We cut taxes 19

1191
01:23:17,889 --> 01:23:18,030
times.

1192
01:23:18,030 --> 01:23:18,929
MR. LEHRER: Well, what would you do as president?

1193
01:23:18,929 --> 01:23:23,139
MR. ROMNEY: We — as president, I will sit
down on day one — actually the day after

1194
01:23:23,139 --> 01:23:27,360
I get elected, I'll sit down with leaders
— the Democratic leaders as well as Republican

1195
01:23:27,360 --> 01:23:31,760
leaders and — as we did in my state. We
met every Monday for a couple hours, talked

1196
01:23:31,760 --> 01:23:35,059
about the issues and the challenges in the
— in the — in our state, in that case.

1197
01:23:35,059 --> 01:23:40,829
We have to work on a collaborative basis — not
because we're going to compromise our principle(s),

1198
01:23:40,829 --> 01:23:42,289
but because there's common ground.

1199
01:23:42,289 --> 01:23:46,729
And the challenges America faces right now
— look, the reason I'm in this race is there

1200
01:23:46,729 --> 01:23:50,699
are people that are really hurting today in
this country, and we face — this deficit

1201
01:23:50,699 --> 01:23:55,139
could crush the future generations. What's
happening in the Middle East? There are developments

1202
01:23:55,139 --> 01:24:02,249
around the world that are of real concern.
And Republicans and Democrats both love America,

1203
01:24:02,249 --> 01:24:06,699
but we need to have leadership — leadership
in Washington that will actually bring people

1204
01:24:06,699 --> 01:24:12,179
together and get the job done and could not
care less if it's a Republican or a Democrat.

1205
01:24:12,179 --> 01:24:14,260
I've done it before. I'll do it again.

1206
01:24:14,260 --> 01:24:15,139
MR. LEHRER: Mr. President.

1207
01:24:15,139 --> 01:24:17,579
PRESIDENT OBAMA: Well, first of all, I think
Governor Romney's going to have a busy first

1208
01:24:17,579 --> 01:24:21,860
day, because he's also going to repeal "Obamacare,"
which will not be very popular among Democrats

1209
01:24:21,860 --> 01:24:23,960
as you're sitting down with them.

1210
01:24:23,960 --> 01:24:25,179
(Laughter.)

1211
01:24:25,179 --> 01:24:32,920
But look, my philosophy has been I will take
ideas from anybody, Democrat or Republican,

1212
01:24:32,920 --> 01:24:36,889
as long as they're advancing the cause of
making middle-class families stronger and

1213
01:24:36,889 --> 01:24:41,010
giving ladders of opportunity into the middle
class. That's how we cut taxes for middle-class

1214
01:24:41,010 --> 01:24:44,440
families and small businesses. That's how
we cut a trillion dollars of spending that

1215
01:24:44,440 --> 01:24:49,940
wasn't advancing that cause. That's how we
signed three trade deals into law that are

1216
01:24:49,940 --> 01:24:54,469
helping us to double our exports and sell
more American products around the world. That's

1217
01:24:54,469 --> 01:24:59,249
how we repealed "don't ask, don't tell." That's
how we ended the war in Iraq, as I promised,

1218
01:24:59,249 --> 01:25:03,489
and that's how we're going to wind down the
war in Afghanistan. That's how we went after

1219
01:25:03,489 --> 01:25:05,699
al-Qaida and bin Laden.

1220
01:25:05,699 --> 01:25:12,289
So we've — we've seen progress even under
Republican control of the House or Representatives.

1221
01:25:12,289 --> 01:25:17,090
But ultimately, part of being principled,
part of being a leader is, A, being able to

1222
01:25:17,090 --> 01:25:22,989
describe exactly what it is that you intend
to do, not just saying, I'll sit down, but

1223
01:25:22,989 --> 01:25:24,969
you have to have a plan.

1224
01:25:24,969 --> 01:25:30,659
Number two, what's important is occasionally
you've got to say now to — to — to folks

1225
01:25:30,659 --> 01:25:35,550
both in your own party and in the other party.
And you know, yes, have we had some fights

1226
01:25:35,550 --> 01:25:40,449
between me and the Republicans when they fought
back against us, reining in the excesses of

1227
01:25:40,449 --> 01:25:45,179
Wall Street? Absolutely, because that was
a fight that needed to be had. When — when

1228
01:25:45,179 --> 01:25:49,030
we were fighting about whether or not we were
going to make sure that Americans had more

1229
01:25:49,030 --> 01:25:53,179
security with their health insurance and they
said no, yes, that was a fight that we needed

1230
01:25:53,179 --> 01:26:00,260
to have. And so part of leadership and governing
is both saying what it is that you are for,

1231
01:26:00,260 --> 01:26:02,559
but also being willing to say no to some things.

1232
01:26:02,559 --> 01:26:06,110
And I've got to tell you, Governor Romney,
when it comes to his own party during the

1233
01:26:06,110 --> 01:26:10,989
course of this campaign, has not displayed
that willingness to say no to some of the

1234
01:26:10,989 --> 01:26:12,840
more extreme parts of his party.

1235
01:26:12,840 --> 01:26:18,769
MR. LEHRER: That brings us to closing statements.
There was a coin toss. Governor Romney, you

1236
01:26:18,769 --> 01:26:21,210
won the toss, and you elected to go last.

1237
01:26:21,210 --> 01:26:24,530
So you have a closing two minutes, Mr. President.

1238
01:26:24,530 --> 01:26:27,599
PRESIDENT OBAMA: Well, Jim, I want to thank
you and I want to thank Governor Romney, because

1239
01:26:27,599 --> 01:26:31,030
I think this was a terrific debate and I very
much appreciate it.

1240
01:26:31,030 --> 01:26:34,690
And I want to thank the University of Denver.

1241
01:26:34,690 --> 01:26:45,679
You know, four years ago we were going through
a major crisis, and yet my faith and confidence

1242
01:26:45,679 --> 01:26:52,530
in the American future is undiminished. And
the reason is because of its people. Because

1243
01:26:52,530 --> 01:26:57,219
of the woman I met in North Carolina who decided
at 55 to go back to school because she wanted

1244
01:26:57,219 --> 01:27:01,469
to inspire her daughter, and now has a new
job from that new training that she's gotten.

1245
01:27:01,469 --> 01:27:06,389
Because of the company in Minnesota who was
willing to give up salaries and perks for

1246
01:27:06,389 --> 01:27:11,079
their executives to make sure that they didn't
lay off workers during a recession. The auto

1247
01:27:11,079 --> 01:27:16,659
workers that you meet in Toledo or Detroit
take such pride in building the best cars

1248
01:27:16,659 --> 01:27:22,090
in the world — not just because of a paycheck,
but because it gives them that sense of pride,

1249
01:27:22,090 --> 01:27:24,380
that they're helping to build America.

1250
01:27:24,380 --> 01:27:27,659
And so the question now is, how do we build
on those strengths? And everything that I've

1251
01:27:27,659 --> 01:27:31,820
tried to do and everything that I'm now proposing
for the next four years in terms of improving

1252
01:27:31,820 --> 01:27:37,110
our education system, or developing American
energy, or making sure that we're closing

1253
01:27:37,110 --> 01:27:40,809
loopholes for companies that are shipping
jobs overseas and focusing on small businesses

1254
01:27:40,809 --> 01:27:44,429
and companies that are creating jobs here
in the United States, or — or closing our

1255
01:27:44,429 --> 01:27:49,340
deficit in a responsible, balanced way that
allows us to invest in our future — all

1256
01:27:49,340 --> 01:27:56,159
those things are designed to make sure that
the American people, their genius, their grit,

1257
01:27:56,159 --> 01:28:03,139
their determination is — is channeled, and
— and — and they have an opportunity to

1258
01:28:03,139 --> 01:28:03,570
succeed.

1259
01:28:03,570 --> 01:28:07,809
And everybody's getting a fair shot and everybody's
getting a fair share. Everybody's doing a

1260
01:28:07,809 --> 01:28:10,380
fair share and everybody's playing by the
same rules.

1261
01:28:10,380 --> 01:28:16,409
You know, four years ago I said that I'm not
a perfect man and I wouldn't be a perfect

1262
01:28:16,409 --> 01:28:21,210
president. And that's probably a promise that
Governor Romney thinks I've kept. But I also

1263
01:28:21,210 --> 01:28:26,210
promised that I'd fight every single day on
behalf of the American people and the middle

1264
01:28:26,210 --> 01:28:28,999
class and all those who are striving to get
in the middle class.

1265
01:28:28,999 --> 01:28:34,969
I've kept that promise and if you'll vote
for me, then I promise I'll fight just as

1266
01:28:34,969 --> 01:28:35,570
hard in a second term.

1267
01:28:35,570 --> 01:28:37,499
MR. LEHRER: Governor Romney, your two-minute
closing.

1268
01:28:37,499 --> 01:28:42,280
MR. ROMNEY: Thank you, Jim and Mr. President.
And thank you for tuning in this evening.

1269
01:28:42,280 --> 01:28:46,559
This is a — this is an important election.
And I'm concerned about America. I'm concerned

1270
01:28:46,559 --> 01:28:52,119
about the direction America has been taking
over the last four years. I know this is bigger

1271
01:28:52,119 --> 01:28:58,559
than election about the two of us as individuals.
It's bigger than our respective parties. It's

1272
01:28:58,559 --> 01:29:02,570
an election about the course of America — what
kind of America do you want to have for yourself

1273
01:29:02,570 --> 01:29:04,199
and for your children.

1274
01:29:04,199 --> 01:29:07,449
And there really are two very different paths
that we began speaking about this evening.

1275
01:29:07,449 --> 01:29:10,690
And over the course of this month we're going
to have two more presidential debates and

1276
01:29:10,690 --> 01:29:14,829
vice presidential debate. We'll talk about
those two paths. But they lead in very different

1277
01:29:14,829 --> 01:29:19,329
directions. And it's not just looking to our
words that you have to take in evidence of

1278
01:29:19,329 --> 01:29:20,849
where they go; you can look at the record.

1279
01:29:20,849 --> 01:29:24,449
There's no question in my mind that if the
president were to be re-elected you'll continue

1280
01:29:24,449 --> 01:29:29,880
to see a middle-class squeeze with incomes
going down and prices going up. I'll get incomes

1281
01:29:29,880 --> 01:29:35,039
up again. You'll see chronic unemployment.
We've had 43 straight months with unemployment

1282
01:29:35,039 --> 01:29:40,519
above 8 percent. If I'm president, I will
create — help create 12 million new jobs

1283
01:29:40,519 --> 01:29:42,780
in this country with rising incomes.

1284
01:29:42,780 --> 01:29:47,530
If the president's re-elected, "Obamacare"
will be fully installed. In my view, that's

1285
01:29:47,530 --> 01:29:51,409
going to mean a whole different way of life
for people who counted on the insurance plan

1286
01:29:51,409 --> 01:29:55,690
they had in the past. Many will lose it. You're
going to see health premiums go up by some

1287
01:29:55,690 --> 01:30:01,139
$2,500 per — per family. If I'm elected,
we won't have "Obamacare." We'll put in place

1288
01:30:01,139 --> 01:30:05,340
the kind of principles that I put in place
in my own state and allow each state to craft

1289
01:30:05,340 --> 01:30:09,479
their own programs to get people insured.
And we'll focus on getting the cost of health

1290
01:30:09,479 --> 01:30:10,889
care down.

1291
01:30:10,889 --> 01:30:16,889
If the president were to be re-elected, you're
going to see a $716 billion cut to Medicare.

1292
01:30:16,889 --> 01:30:20,479
You'll have 4 million people who will lose
Medicare advantage. You'll have hospitals

1293
01:30:20,479 --> 01:30:23,469
and providers that'll no longer accept Medicare
patients.

1294
01:30:23,469 --> 01:30:27,159
I'll restore that $716 billion to Medicare.

1295
01:30:27,159 --> 01:30:31,949
And finally, military. If the president's
re-elected, you'll see dramatic cuts to our

1296
01:30:31,949 --> 01:30:36,780
military. The secretary of defense has said
these would be even devastating. I will not

1297
01:30:36,780 --> 01:30:41,360
cut our commitment to our military. I will
keep America strong and get America's middle

1298
01:30:41,360 --> 01:30:42,869
class working again.

1299
01:30:42,869 --> 01:30:43,340
Thank you, Jim.

1300
01:30:43,340 --> 01:30:44,550
MR. LEHRER: Thank you, Governor.

1301
01:30:44,550 --> 01:30:46,030
Thank you, Mr. President.

1302
01:30:46,030 --> 01:30:51,229
The next debate will be the vice presidential
event on Thursday, October 11th at Center

1303
01:30:51,229 --> 01:30:56,199
College in Danville, Kentucky. For now, from
the University of Denver, I'm Jim Lehrer.

1304
01:30:56,199 --> 99:59:59,000
Thank you, and good night. (Cheers, applause.)
